Oil Falls Back On Large Fuel Build.html,"A day after the American Petroleum Institute surprised market yet again with a crude oil inventory draw, pushing prices up, the Energy Information Administration also reported an inventory decline, at 2.1 million barrels for the week to May 29. At 532.3 million barrels, the authority said, crude oil inventories were 12 percent above the five-year average for this time of the year. Analysts had expected an inventory build of 3.3 million barrels, after last week the EIA reported a substantial inventory increase, at 7.9 million barrels, for the third week of May. Last week, gasoline inventories rose, however, by 2.8 million barrels, following a modest draw of 700,000 barrels a week earlier. Gasoline production over the last week of May averaged 7.8 million bpd, up from the previous week, when the average was 7.2 million bpd.
 In distillate fuels, the EIA reported an inventory build of 9.9 million barrels for the week to May 29. This was up from an inventory increase of 5.5 million barrels for the previous week. Distillate fuel production averaged 4.7 million bpd last week, compared with 4.8 million bpd a week earlier. Refinery runs averaged 13.3 million bpd in the last week of May, compared with 13 million bpd a week earlier, signaling the continued improvement in fuel demand as the United States emerges from lockdowns. Prices this week have been on the climb, even before the API reported its estimate of a crude oil inventory draw. At the time of writing, Brent crude was trading at $$39.36, after touching $40 for the first time in months yesterday, and West Texas Intermediate was changing hands at $36.87 a barrel.
 There is growing optimism that the OPEC+ club will later this week agree to continue cutting production at the current rate of 9.7 million bpd even beyond the end-June deadline for the deep cuts. There is also optimism, although more guarded, about the global economy in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. Both have contributed to a more bullish view on oil prices."
US Oil Drillers Restart Production As Prices Recover.html,"Shale drillers are bringing some shuttered oil production back online as the glut eases.  The total amount of shut-in production in the Bakken stood at 475,000 bpd on May 28, a total that was 7 percent smaller than the week before, according to Bloomberg. A couple of high-profile shale companies voiced optimism at the start of June. EOG Resources said it plans to “accelerate” production in the second half of 2020, finding prevailing oil prices sufficient to step up drilling activity. The company also reduced its hedging exposure, a sign that the company is bullish about the trajectory of prices. In addition, in an investor presentation, Parsley Energy also said that it is bringing back the “vast majority” of its curtailed production in June. Parsley shut down around 400 wells in March. Oil prices have shot up from negative territory in April to the mid-$30s by early June. The extreme supply overhang has mostly been corrected by steep production cuts, aided by the bounce back in demand.  The three-month slump and the near total halt drilling activity has ratcheted up the pressure on shale drillers. Debt has not gone away, so there is a need for cash flow. Drillers are clearly itchy to begin bringing output back online again. WTI rising to the mid-$30s may be just enough to entice oil back onto the market.
 “We see more evidence that the horizontal oil rig count is approaching the bottom of this down cycle,” Bjornar Tonhaugen, Head of Oil Markets at Rystad Energy, said in a statement. “However, what will determine the short term trajectory for US oil production is how quickly operators bring back parts of our estimated 1.65 million bpd of shut-in well production.” The potential decision by OPEC+ to extend the production cuts for another two months, which seems the most likely outcome at this point, would pave the way for more U.S. shale production to come back online.  Related: The World Has Too Many Oil Refineries With that said, some analysts say that the restart of production is premature. Two weeks ago, Standard Chartered wrote in a report: “If the North Dakota data starts to show the shut-in wells’ tally stabilising and then falling back within the next two or three weeks, we would take that as evidence that the current WTI rally has probably overshot.” The bank revisited that assessment in a report on June 2. “That time now appears to have come; output in the Bakken shale is rising,” the bank said. “The return of 700 wells and 35kb/d of output in North Dakota is not significant in itself; however, it matters because of its ‘canary in a coalmine’ quality.” North Dakota tends to have more granular and timely data on drilling activity. 
 Standard Chartered analysts went on to say that if wells are coming back in the Bakken, then they are probably also coming back in Texas, New Mexico and Oklahoma.  Still, opening up shuttered wells is different from drilling brand new wells. The extreme state of oversupply is ebbing, but just because a few wells can cover opex costs at $35 per barrel, the U.S. shale industry is not roaring back to life. Oilfield services company ProPetro Holding Corp. said there are only about 20 fracking fleets in the Permian, down from 172 a year ago. The rig count also continues to fall, plunging to 222 last week. The Permian lost another 14 rigs, while rigs are hanging on by a thread in most other shale basins. “During the previous downturn in 2015-16, horizontal oil drilling bottomed in May 2016 at about 250 rigs, nearly 50 rigs higher than the activity level seen right now,” Tonhaugen of Rystad said.  $30 oil might be enough to open up shuttered wells, but the industry probably needs prices “around USD $45/bbl to start any significant recovery in completions and new drilling, and for many operators it would take USD 50 /bbl or more,” Standard Chartered said."
Can Yemens Oil Industry Make A Comeback.html,"The coronavirus pandemic has dealt an immense blow to businesses and nations all around the planet, yet there is one specific sphere where it might actually deliver some positive outcomes – namely, ending long-standing and costly wars. The Yemeni civil war, one of the most sanguinary conflicts of the 21st century that has rekindled internecine distrust and elevated regional tensions to a new peak, might be the most realistic case in point as countries of the Gulf prepare for a virtual donors’ conference next week, organized for the alleged purpose of helping Yemen overcome COVID-19. As the country remains split between the Houthi north and the Saudi-backed south, there is no easy military victory to achieve for Saudi Arabia and its allies and hence, the money spent on Yemen might be rerouted for domestic purposes, such as alleviating the discontentment of the populace. Yemen’s oil-producing story has plenty of similarities to that of Syria – before the oil crash of 2009 it used to produce some 300-350kbpd, however first due to external market conditions and then due to the immediate effects of armed conflict Yemeni crude output has plummeted quite spectacularly. The low point was reached at the height of fighting in 2016, then Yemeni production hovered around 40kbpd. As of late 2019 Yemen has managed to produce some 60kbpd of crude and, with domestic refining virtually non-existent, even managed to export some of it to predominantly Chinese customers. The past years have seen Yemeni deliveries to India, Japan, Italy or Malaysia, however all of 2020 cargoes have been to China.   As opposed to Syria whose oil sector is still heavily debilitated by international sanctions, Yemen could move towards a restart of oil production relatively soon – the only thing it needs is a cessation of hostilities. In early April 2020 Saudi Arabia has announced a unilateral ceasefire, the official reasoning for this bold move was revolving around the start of Ramadan, however the reason why Riyadh would want to end the conflict is much more trivial – in times of missing government revenues (2020 budget is breakeven at an oil price of $85 per barrel) the Saudi kingdom needs to go into saving mode if it wants to survive the pandemic without domestic upheaval. In addition to domestic pressures, the dissociation of the United Arab Emirates and Sudan from fighting in Yemen puts Riyadh even more at the forefront of a potential diplomatic settlement with the Houthis. 
  Related: Russia Is Quickly Becoming The Most Dominant Force In Energy Saudi Arabia’s unilateral withdrawal presents a double whammy for Yemen – under conditions of a dual government it needs to confront COVID-19 (it has one of the worst corona virus death rates globally, 77 deaths per 310 cases as of June 01) all the while its healthcare-related infrastructure was pounded for 5 years by Saudi-led air strikes, as a result of which only half of the country’s pre-civil war hospitals are operating. Hence, the current situation remains largely hazy for international oil companies – the lack of clarity on Saudi Arabia’s plans with Yemen, the continuous partition into two parts and low oil prices render any IOC return quote unrealistic. Hence, most probably the only company to continue drilling new acreage in Yemen in the near future will be the state-owned PetroMasila and Safer.  It must be pointed out that Yemen already hosts two foreign companies, although one of them seems to be intent on leaving the country. The Indonesian independent oil firm PT Medco controls the Block 82 concession (Wadi Amed) but has already filed last year for its relinquishment – which still failed to take place as the relevant government approval is missing. This leaves the Austrian OMV in the privileged position of being the only NOC that is currently producing in Yemen – on its Block S-2 it resumed oil production in April 2018 and has been pumping some 4kbpd of crude from the Habban oil field. Generally speaking, very little of Yemen’s hydrocarbon bounty is located in Houthi-controlled territory. Nevertheless, the Yemeni authorities are experiencing intense difficulty in bringing crude, most of which is in the Marib Basin in the central part of the country, to seaside ports from where they can be shipped elsewhere. 
 First of all, before the Civil war Yemeni crude was sent to the Ras Isa port on the Red Sea coast – the pipeline connecting the Masila and Marib Basins to Ras Isa was blown up in 2015 and remains non-serviceable to the present day. Second, in order to use the Bir Ali port on the Indian Ocean coast companies have to truck their production to the collection point in the Marib Basin – this in itself is a great achievement as before 2020 they had to truck the crude for 100-150km as the pipeline extension to Marib was still not ready. Yemen’s flagship export grade Masila is shipped from the Ash Shihr terminal on the eastern shore of the Gulf of Aden – being the farthest from Houthi-controlled territory, this crude stream is at the same time the safest from the above mentioned ones.   One of the very few bright stories that one might search for in the past 5 years of continued conflict is the relative intactness of Yemen’s LNG industry. Albeit out of operation, the Yemen LNG plant located in Balhaf is without substantial damage (so far only one pipeline was damaged in fights) and might be restarted relatively easily given that safety conditions are suitable. Total remains the operator of Yemen LNG and along with Kogas is the main marketer of Yemeni liquefied gas (Total’s LNG marketing portfolio also includes 2.5mtpa of gas from Engie, transferred to the oil major on the back of a global deal whereby all of Engie’s LNG is transferred to Total). The LNG terminal ought to be fed by some 12.5 BCm per year of natural gas from Block 18 in the Marib Basin, it only functioned a bit more than 5 years before going into force majeure and evacuating all relevant staff in 2015."
Petrobras Oil Stockpiles Are Paradoxically Low.html,"Brazil’s Petrobras is one of very few oil companies with no oil storage problem, according to its chief executive. Roberto Castello Blanco said at an event yesterday that Petrobras’s oil stockpiles are “paradoxically” very low, Reuters reports. This level of inventories is a result of strong demand for the company’s products abroad, Castello Blanco added, noting that since he took the helm of the company, it has invested heavily in its overseas trading business division, and this investment has paid off in stronger exports. Despite strong exports, however, last month Petrobras warned its shareholders that the coronavirus pandemic could leave a scar on the global economy, specifically on consumer behaviors, which would in turn affect the oil industry as it affects demand for the commodities it produces.
 Petrobras reported a net loss of $9.7 billion for the first quarter of the year, from a profit of $1.98 billion for the last quarter of 2019. The loss resulted from an impairment charge of $13.4 billion, related to the company’s shallow water and deepwater assets. ""The assets that had their values adjusted are mostly oil fields in shallow and deep waters, whose investment decision was made in the past and based on more optimistic expectations for long-term prices,"" Petrobras said in May. ""We are not surprised by its devaluation in a more challenging environment."" Now, Petrobras expects Brent to average $25 a barrel this year and only rise by about $5 annually until 2025, to reach $50. This is a lot more pessimistic than most analysts’ projections for this year and lower than Brent is trading at right now, too. Most price forecasts are around the $40 a barrel mark.
 Meanwhile, Petrobras continues with its divestment program: the company earlier this week said it had completed the sale of seven offshore fields and had opened the non-binding phase for another offshore asset."
Offshore Oil Is On The Brink Of Collapse.html,"Project cancellations, spending cuts, well shut-ins: the problems and dilemmas plaguing onshore oil producers have also spread to offshore. And while the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on onshore drilling may already be wearing off here and there where drilling is cheap, they may linger for longer offshore.  Despite major progress made by oil companies in the cost department, offshore drilling often remains more expensive than onshore drilling, not least because the process of extraction is more complex. These are costs that one can’t cut or forgo. What this means in the current environment, is that offshore oil may suffer more than onshore oil.  In the North Sea, almost a third of the oil left on the UK continental shelf is no longer economical to extract, a recent study found. According to it, with Brent crude at $45 a barrel, 28 percent of the oil was uneconomical. But Brent hasn’t traded at $45 a barrel for months and is unlikely to reach even $40 a barrel by the end of this year if we are to believe oil analysts. This means that more oil will become uneconomical, and not just in the North Sea. In the U.S. section of the Gulf of Mexico, Baker Hughes reported a rig count of just 12 in its latest weekly rig count report. That’s down from 22 in March and 19 in April. Forbes’ Scott Carpenter notes this was the lowest weekly rig count in ten years. And it is not unlikely the rig count will continue to fall if prices stay where they are. Meanwhile, production platforms are shutting down, too. Related: $30 Oil Isn’t Good Enough For U.S. Shale When shale drillers began suspending production because their breakeven prices were higher than the production costs of a barrel of oil in most parts of the U.S. shale patch, there was worry some of that production may be lost forever. The same is true of offshore production. The Wall Street Journal reported last month that producers in the Gulf are shuttering production, and many fear it might take years before this production returns. What is happening in the Gulf of Mexico is happening elsewhere as well, with producers pressured by crippled demand.
 “I felt like I had a pretty good handle on it (2020 activity) three weeks ago, but I just don’t know right now,” one industry executive told WorkBoat in mid-March. “What I would have told you then is that based on what we saw through the course of 2019, and even at the beginning of this year, activity was increasing in the deepwater,” the executive VP of Jackson Offshore Operators said. The truth is, nobody knew any of this would happen. The oil industry was caught unawares by both the price war and the pandemic, and it is still reeling from the blow. In the offshore segment, there appear to be three main challenges, according to Rystad Energy: a sharp drop in offshore oilfield services and equipment, financial vulnerability, and excessive capacity, Offshore Magazine’s Jessica Stump reported last month. These are by no means unique to offshore but they may have more severe consequences there: offshore projects take longer to get from approval to launch, which means the current project delays—and the cancellations—could stump offshore production growth for years, if not permanently. Then there are the bankruptcies. According to Rystad Energy, the Covid-19 pandemic could lead to a drop of $5 billion in oilfield services purchases in Europe—a continent that extracts almost all of its oil offshore—which means that a fifth of providers of these services could go under. And Europe is not the only place where offshore oil accounts for most or all oil output.  Related: Have Oil Traders Abandoned Fundamentals?
 Many frontier regions, notably in Africa and South America, would suffer setbacks because of the crisis, which IHS Markit estimates may wipe out 14 percent of oil demand this quarter. That’s about 14 million bpd, based on 2019 oil demand of some 100 million bpd. Others are more pessimistic. BP expects demand decline during the second quarter of 16 million bpd. Rystad estimates demand loss at as much as 27 million bpd for April alone, and Trafigura sees the April demand loss at 35 million bpd.  Offshore oil accounts for almost a third of the global total. It tends to be costlier to extract than onshore oil, but it has a longer life than unconventional onshore oil. A whole segment of oilfield services is focused exclusively on offshore drilling and production. Many of the companies in that segment might not survive the crisis.  And then there are the wider economic repercussions of the offshore oil crisis. For areas such as Brazil and the Gulf of Guinea, project delays and cancellations in offshore projects, which have suddenly become too expensive to develop, would mean economic trouble on top of already weak oil revenues because of international prices.  Last time, offshore oil emerged from the crisis leaner, more cost-efficient, and with lower breakevens, among the supermajors, at least. We are yet to see how the industry will emerge from this crisis."
Suncor Energy Transition Will Destroy Oil Demand.html,"Low-carbon technologies could disrupt global oil demand in the not-too-distant future the way COVID-19 crushed demand during the lockdowns worldwide, Mark Little, chief executive of one of Canada’s largest oil producers, Suncor Energy, wrote in an opinion piece published on Monday. “The temporary economic lockdown triggered by the 2020 pandemic is giving us a glimpse into a not-too-distant future where the transformation of our energy system could disrupt demand on a similar scale. Disruption breeds opportunity and forward-looking companies and countries will need to step up and lead,” Little and Laura Kilcrease, CEO of Alberta Innovates, wrote in an article in the Corporate Knights magazine.   According to Suncor’s chief executive, Canada’s oil sands industry is positioned to lead in some innovative low-carbon solutions, such as carbon fiber – a material increasingly important for producing lighter vehicles, including electric vehicles (EVs). Asphaltene makes up 15-20 percent of bitumen and is the feedstock for making carbon fibers, Suncor’s Little said.
 “If we can figure out how to do this affordably at scale, it has the potential to quadruple the revenue from Alberta’s current bitumen output,’’ according to the executive. Suncor’s manager also called for federal government support for disruptive technology that could unlock more value from Canada’s energy industry. The warning from a top oil executive that the energy transition is set to disrupt oil demand comes amid one of the worst crises in the oil industry in the recent decades.
 Some analysts argue that we may have already hit peak oil demand, considering that the pandemic might result in lasting changes in consumer behavior and lifestyles—and even the bosses of BP and Shell are not ruling out this notion. Last month, Suncor Energy slashed its quarterly dividend by 55 percent to reduce its cash breakeven to a WTI Crude price of US$35 a barrel, as it reported a huge Q1 loss due to impairments stemming from the low oil prices."
US Shale Isnt Losing Sleep Over The 2020 Elections.html,"The battle lines are already drawn in a high-stakes political contest that will ostensibly determine the fate of the American shale industry. On the blue corner is former VP Joe Biden, who has not only pledged to steer the U.S. to a net-zero carbon emissions status by 2050 but is also hell-bent on stopping key oil and gas projects on federal lands and waters including the controversial Keystone XL.  In the red corner is President Trump, who has taken credit for the spectacular surge in U.S. shale oil production, rolled back a raft of regulations on the fossil fuel sector, and sworn to continue doing so if re-elected.  The dynamics in the oil and gas sector have, in the past, determined the outcomes of U.S. presidential elections, which in this case appear to favor Trump courtesy of prevailing low gas prices. The outcome of the elections might, however, ultimately prove to be a moot point in the shale industry's grand scheme of things. That's according to a recent report by the Rapidan Energy Group, which has concluded that whereas the shale industry is likely to bounce back faster under Trump than Biden, even Trump will be powerless to help the industry in a weak macro environment. Weak Recovery  Source: Axios
 Rapidan says that U.S. onshore oil production is likely to clock in 1 million barrels per day lower by 2023 if Joe Biden trounces Donald Trump in the November elections. However, the advantage would be almost negligible if the oil markets are only able to put up a weak recovery.  Related: Stocks To Watch As Shale Bounces Back Rapidan has a base case of Brent crude prices rebounding to the low $50s/b in 2023 while oil demand rises to around 10 million b/d over the timeframe. On the global stage, Rapidan's base case has oil production rising courtesy of returning OPEC+ production, a rebound by Canadian sands, as well as a startup of seven floating production units in Brazil. Rapidan, however, sees Brent plateauing in the mid-$40s/b by 2023 with global crude demand climbing only 7.3 million b/d over the timeframe. Meanwhile, U.S. shale production would come in a good 1 million b/d below the base case in 2021. Nor surprisingly, Rapidan says the tables are likely to turn for Iran if Biden wins with the Middle East nation expected to export 1.8 million b/d just a year after Biden ascends to the Oval Office but might not be allowed to pump that much until the second half of 2022 under Trump. The Silver Lining The Rapidan report is very bearish for U.S. shale, either way.
 The base case--which is the bullish scenario-- has predicted that the U.S. shale industry will not be able to fully recover pre-crisis production levels over the next three years, even under Trump. The projected Brent crude of low $50s/b by 2023 suggests that the majority of shale firms are doomed to remain in the red. The U.S. shale industry is already in dire straits, with hundreds of operators staring at bankruptcy. WTI prices have been range-bound at $32-34/barrel over the past few weeks, with the current WTI price of $33.75 a long way off the ~$50/barrel that many shale producers require to turn a profit. But it's not all doom and gloom though, and Trump might actually be able to do the industry some good. In a recent statement, the International Energy Agency (IEA) head predicted that oil demand is set to rebound and even surpass pre-crisis levels, in lieu of unfavorable government policies: ""In the absence of strong government policies, a sustained economic recovery and low oil prices are likely to take global oil demand back to where it was, and beyond,"" Fatih Birol, Executive Director of the IEA, told Bloomberg earlier this week. Even the industry's biggest bogeyman--renewable energy--is lately facing a backlash even amongst European supermajors that have traditionally been at the frontline of the green energy drive. Total S.A. shareholders have overwhelmingly voted down a resolution to force the company to do more about climate change, while Exxon's shareholders have rejected proposals for a report on lobbying and a report on the risks of petrochemical investments. Low oil prices have led to more than 2.2 million b/d of U.S. oil production being shut down. But ultimately, the cure for low oil prices is low oil prices, and the markets are bound to eventually correct, especially once a supply squeeze begins to threaten."
Oil Market Could See Long Term Contango.html,"The oil market could stay in a state of contango for longer after supply and demand finally balance due to the vast amount of crude and products in storage, Reuters reported on Friday, citing analysts and investment banks. Contango is the state of the market in which prices for delivery at later dates are higher than prompt prices—a market situation signaling oversupply and one which traders use to store oil for delivery at a later date. The opposite market situation—backwardation—typically occurs at times of market deficit and in it, prices for front-month contracts are higher than the ones further out in time.   The supply and demand balance on the oil market could tip into deficit as early as in June, according to some analysts, including Goldman Sachs.
 Improving global oil demand and faster-than-expected production curtailments from outside the OPEC+ pact are set to push the oil market into deficit in June, according to Goldman Sachs. Yet, there is little room for an oil price rally in the near term because of the still sizeable oversupply of crude oil and refined products, Goldman Sachs said in a note in the middle of May. But the contango on the oil market could outlast the immediate deficit because of a high amount of oil on floating storage, according to data from Citi cited by Reuters. “An inflection point is happening in physical fundamentals, although oil-on-water may cast a shadow on the recovery,” according to Citi.
 During the ‘peak lockdown’ period when every major economy except China was under lockdown in late March and early April, the oil market was in a state of super contango. The glut was growing, storage capacity was shrinking as oil demand cratered, and on top of this, OPEC’s leader and the world’s top exporter, Saudi Arabia, was intent on further cratering the market with a supply surge, before it sat down –urged by the U.S. – to forge a new deal with Russia for record production cuts. Since the beginning of May, demand has started to slowly recover while supply is coming off the market from the OPEC+ cuts and economics-driven curtailments in North America. But the sizable oil in storage, including floating storage for which traders have chartered tankers for at least six months, could keep the market in contango even though it could tip into deficit. "
Oil Price Rally Breaks Records In May.html,"Early signs of growing demand for crude oil have prompted a market optimism that has led to increased WTI buying, setting the stage for the benchmark’s best-ever monthly performance, Bloomberg reports--even though the contract’s rally has been somewhat uneven. According to Bloomberg, West Texas Intermediate has increased by nearly 80 percent this month--the highest increase since 1983. Still, this month’s price rise has not been enough to offset the losses that the benchmark, along with all other benchmarks, suffered in the prior three months. WTI, therefore, is still 45 percent lower than it was at the beginning of the year and lower than the breakevens many U.S. shale producers.
 The immediate outlook for WTI, however, remains uncertain. For example, the Energy Information Administration, whose weekly petroleum status report is among the most closely watched indicators of the health of the oil market, yesterday reported another solid crude oil inventory build for last week. The reported build immediately weighed on the benchmark. The report followed a modest inventory draw reported for the previous week, which was embraced as one of those early signs of improving oil demand that could push prices higher. It’s worth noting that despite the inventory draw a couple of weeks ago, total crude oil inventories in the United States continue to be above the five-year average for this time of year. Right now, they are as much as 13 percent above this average. Gasoline and distillate fuel inventories are also above the five-year average: gasoline at some 10 percent above it, and distillate fuels around 24 percent above the average.
 MarketWatch noted that the surge in crude oil stockpiles last week was a result of increased Saudi imports—from that flotilla carrying 40 million barrels that media have been following for weeks—but that only accounted for about 2 million barrels of crude out of an increase of 7.9 million barrels. This most likely means that it is too early to have any expectations for oil prices as market volatility remains extremely high."
Deja Vu OPECs Recurring Oil Production Dilemma.html,"Two conflicting reports about OPEC's plans for oil production surfaced earlier this week--both citing unnamed sources. One set of sources claimed that Russia was considering an extension of the current oil production cuts beyond the end of June. The other set of sources said that Russia was planning to ease the cuts starting in July. This is a perfect illustration of the uncertainty reigning over oil markets. This uncertainty, however, needs to be mitigated, and the most likely one to do it would be the OPEC+ club, together accounting for more than a third of global oil production.  How? By strategizing how to increase oil production in such a way as to not crash prices again-- but also in a way that will keep U.S. shale from stripping away all the benefits from higher prices. It's a tough conundrum. Reuters' John Kemp wrote this week that OPEC+ needs to think about its exit strategy even if we are now just in the first month of actual production cuts. OPEC already has a questionable track record in reversing production cuts to its own benefit, Kemp noted, so the cartel might want to consider changing things, such as swiftly reacting to rising prices--as swiftly as it reacts to falling prices. This would be difficult, however, especially with the wider OPEC+ group. The reason it would be difficult is the substantial difference between breakeven prices for, say, Saudi and Russian oil. This difference needs to be narrowed so the two can be more equal partners, with a larger shared interest. Right now, Russia is comfy with cheaper oil than the Kingdom. This means it can reverse production cuts earlier without suffering too much, to prevent U.S. shale—the ultimate adversary of the OPEC+ group—from getting too bold with its own production plans.
 Saudi Arabia, on the other hand, the de facto leader of Gulf producers, needs much higher oil prices, which puts it in the difficult position of pressing for extended cuts, often at its own expense, as John Kemp notes. ""Saudi Arabia tried to keep prices above $100 per barrel during the first shale boom (2012-2014) and then above $70 per barrel during the second shale boom (2017-2019),"" Kemp wrote. ""Both times, informal targets were too high and led to an unsustainable increase in U.S. shale as well as limiting global oil consumption growth, creating conditions for a subsequent price crash.""  Related: Will U.S. Shale Survive If Oil Hits $40? So, something fundamental needs to change--namely, the Saudi oil breakeven price. This, in turn, means economic reforms to make the country more resilient to oil price shocks. Riyadh has already been forced by the oil price crash to implement some austerity—from its perspective—measures. Perhaps it might be a good idea to keep these in place even after prices stabilize.  Indeed, this seems to be the plan.
 ""These measures that have been undertaken today, as tough as they are, are necessary and beneficial to maintain comprehensive financial and economic stability on the medium and long-term for the interest of the country and its citizens,"" Saudi Finance Minister Mohammed Al Jadaan said at the announcement of a 10-percentage-point VAT increase, the cancellation or delay of a number of public spending projects, and the discontinuing of cost-of-living allowances for public servants, which make up the majority of the Saudi population. This is why U.S. shale was so successful in growing so fast so soon, at the expense of the former ruler of oil markets: it achieved much lower breakeven prices. If there is one lesson OPEC should learn from its experiences with shale, it is to lower breakevens, even if it causes some discomfort among the population. It is a public secret that Saudi Arabia and other Gulf nations have been reluctant to implement austerity measures because they wish to avoid unrest among its citizens. Now, however, it seems like a risk they will just need to take if they truly want to protect their economies from future shocks. Once they do this, these producers might be better placed to respond quickly to any price increases that threaten to spark another surge in U.S. shale production. It's a fine line between success and failure, and OPEC will need to learn how to end up on the success side--and quickly--because prices are already on the rise."
The Oil Storage Crisis Is Far From Over.html,"It’s more than a month since the oil markets sunk to a nadir in the mother-of-all market routs. Since then, oil prices have staged an impressive recovery, especially from WTI’s negative trade zone visited on April 20. There’s real optimism in the air with the formidable headwinds of a massive supply glut and limited storage nearly in the back mirror while the markets even recently dodged a big bullet.  Yet, resting uncomfortably in the back of trading minds is this: Oil storage remains painfully squeezed, raising the specter of another April-esque selloff. Ships full of crude are still anchored in the high seas off the coasts of the U.S., China, Europe, and elsewhere with onshore storage sold out and refinery run rates across the globe still a long way off their usual clips. But this time, there’s a different method to the ongoing madness. High Stakes for Oil Traders The obvious reason for the ongoing shortage of space to store oil is that global oil consumption remains depressed despite economies gradually emerging from lockdown. A new report by the International Energy Agency (IEA) has projected that global oil demand in May is set to decline ~25 mb/d compared to a year ago with June demand clocking in at ~15 mb/d below last year’s corresponding period. In fact, the organization expects December demand to still fall short by ~3 mb/d.  Source: IEA
 However, looking at refinery margins tells a different story. Gasoline crack spreads have improved quite dramatically over the past eight weeks with the NYMEX front-month RBOB vs. front-month NYMEX crack clocking in at $11.92/barrel on Monday. Crack spreads represent the economics of refining a barrel of crude oil into its various constituent products. The metric is viewed as a useful proxy for gauging real-time demand for crude and various distillates, and right now, it’s saying that oil demand might not be as poor as previously feared.  Related: Oil Prices Fall On Bearish EIA Data The refinery trajectory looks promising and suggests that there might be something else to blame for the gridlock.  Source: CME Group You can chalk up the unfolding situation to smart traders who have been eyeing the oil contango profits. Bloomberg has reported that some of the oil supertankers off the South African coast have been chartered by leading oil-trading companies, including Vitol Group, Mercuria Energy Group Ltd. and Glencore Plc, through its ST Shipping subsidiary. The traders are ostensibly looking to either purchase the cheap crude and sell the more expensive forward contracts to lock in profits or simply hold the oil and wait for crude prices to rise before selling. By placing large bets on physical crude, oil traders have been directly contributing to the dearth of oil storage while also exacerbating the volatility in the markets. Bloomberg has estimated that the flotilla of tankers is carrying enough oil to meet about 20% of the world’s daily oil demand, more than enough to keep a lid on prices while also keeping prices volatile. Thriving on Chaos
 That said, it’s this kind of situation that oil traders actually thrive on. Bloomberg reported in January that dozens of large oil traders made billions of dollars in profits in 2019 thanks in large part to choppy markets. Independent traders such as Vitol Group, Mercuria, and Trafigura all posted record profits with some like Mercuria declaring it their best trading year ever.  Related: How Long Until Hydrogen Is Competitive At The Pump? But it’s not just independent traders that made a killing. In-house trading units of oil giants such as BP Plc, Royal Dutch Shell Plc, and Total Plc made even bigger profits considering that a company like Shell trades the equivalent of 13 million barrels of oil per day, nearly double the 7.5Mb/d by Vitol.  Source: Bloomberg Much of last year’s volatility was triggered by a stream of supply disruptions. Oil markets have been a lot more volatile this year, which could set the stage for another bumper year for oil traders as we predicted here. Unfortunately, it could also mean that the smooth recovery in oil prices that many investors have been hoping for just won’t happen."
Huge Oil Fields Could Help Iran To Seize Saudi Market Share In China.html,"Given that China’s oil demand has now recovered from the COVID-19 outbreak to even higher levels than before, Iran is operating at full tilt to optimise the oil available to key ally Beijing from any and all of its fields. Principally this involves optimising output from the cluster of supergiant fields in the West Karoun oil region, attempting to increase the average recovery rate from older fields, and pushing forward on production increases from fields shared with Iraq and Kuwait. All of this is geared to twin objectives: increasing Iran’s crude oil production to 5.7 million barrels per day (bpd) by the end of the sixth development plan (ending in 2021/22), and ensuring that it is able to provide China with the steady flow of oil that it requires. Given the variability of Russia’s support for Iran over recent years, Tehran believes that China is a better bet for Iran’s future. Like Russia, China has one of just five Permanent Member votes in the United Nations Security Council (plus the U.S., U.K., and France) but, unlike Russia, China absolutely needs both Iran in its Middle East client-state line-up, given its multi-generational ‘One Belt One Road’ strategy. Aside from the supergiant fields of West Karoun that OilPrice.com has covered extensively in recent months, top of the list of key sites for Iran are two fields that have always been deliberately kept under the international radar by Iran for two main reasons. First, virtually all of their output goes exclusively to China, so given the current sanctions-happy U.S. Presidential Administration that is sanctioning Iran and is set to resume where it left off in a full-scale trade war with China, it pays to keep this arrangement quiet. Second, given the tumult that resulted amongst large swathes of the Iranian people when it was revealed that China was receiving extremely beneficial deals for some of Iran’s prime oil and gas assets, it pays to keep the fact that China is also receiving huge discounts on the oil from these fields quiet as well.  Related: Will There Be Another Oil Price War? The ‘lesser’ of these two fields – which has quietly been producing around 200,000 bpd of oil for export to China for years – is Doroud. Conservatively estimated to contain 7.6 billion barrels of oil in place, Doroud’s full output potential has been hindered over the years by various incompetent attempts to increase production, including damaging efforts to inject water and gas by domestic and foreign operators. As a result of this, up until recently it was anticipated that just 1.5 billion barrels of oil were recoverable from the field. However, recent estimates, factoring in advances in technology that is still accessible for Iran despite sanctions, have increased this figure to 2.5 billion barrels and Tehran-based oil and gas industry figures spoke to by OilPrice.com last week, believe that the real figure is probably over 3 billion barrels.
 The first big development effort came in 1997 when 42 wells were drilled in the field, comprised of 19 offshore and 23 onshore. Two years later, Iran signed an agreement with French energy major Total for the development of Doroud but its plan to inject gas into the field in a specifically sequenced schedule did not happen and the project was halted. Nonetheless, in 2002 the first wave of enhanced recovery from the Doroud field began in earnest at a rate of 15,000 to 16,000 bpd, with production increasing as new wells were drilled in the field. Currently, the crude oil processing installations are used for treating 100,000 bpd offshore and 110,000 bpd onshore and according to a statement last week from the National Iranian Oil Company’s (NIOC) Directorate of Corporate Planning, the investment needed in the Doroud field to bring it up to full capacity will be recouped over a six-year period from the increase in the crude oil production capacity. “China is the backstop bid for all of Iran’s oil and gas-related projects, and will also provide all necessary technology if Iran is lacking it, and is very keen to put its own people on the ground in Iran at any and all of these projects as well,” a senior oil and gas industry source who works closely with Iran’s Petroleum Ministry told OilPrice.com last week. The other – ‘major’ – field is Arvand, although the current situation there is unsettled. “Basically, the Arvand site comprises three areas from a legal perspective and there are ongoing issues with which country – Iran, Iraq, and/or Kuwait, and any combination of those – owns what part,” the Iran source said. “There are two segments jointly owned by Iran and Iraq – and there are various disputes going on over where the exact boundaries are and the drilling activities of each in these - and there is a third section which is disputed by Iran, Iraq, and Kuwait, with Kuwait’s claim based on the claim that its territory extends into the Persian Gulf offshore section,” he added. “Although the Kuwait claim looks tenuous at first sight, the fact is that there are legacy issues relating to the Iraq invasion of Kuwait many years ago, and also questions over the shape and extent of the undersea reservoir and added to this is that Kuwait is a firm ally of the U.S., whereas obviously Iran is not and Iraq is under review in that context,” he highlighted.  Related: Have Oil Traders Abandoned Fundamentals? The problem for Iran is that this third section is the biggest of all three by a very long way. The areas of Arvand over which Iran currently definitely has some claim are estimated to contain around one billion barrels of oil in place with a recovery rate of about 15 per cent, and the site also holds around 14 billion cubic metres of dry gas and about 55 million barrels of gas condensate. These parts of the Arvand field lie parallel along the Iran-Iraq border, with drilling having started in 2006 for the purpose of estimating the hydrocarbon potential of the formations in the Khami and Bangestan centres. Logging operations were also carried out at about that time in the Fahlyan formation to prove the existence of oil and gas there as well, with all activities administered by the Arvandan Oil and Gas Production Company (AOGPC). Partly in anticipation of a massive surge in output - both from the two sections of Arvand shared by Iran and Iraq and on the promise of much more to come from the third segment - the AOGPC, under the orders of the NIOC, constructed a 165,000-barrel-per-day processing unit very close to the drilling sites.
 However, according to the Iran source, the section that is under dispute by Iran, Iraq, and Kuwait, is estimated to have reserves of 6 billion barrels, with at least 18 per cent of that deemed recoverable. “The [Petroleum] Ministry’s estimates – and those of the NIOC – are that this section is relatively straightforward to develop, given the right equipment and technology, with an average cost recovery per barrel being at least 15 per cent lower than the lowest average recovery rate in the region – that is US$1.65 to US$1.70 per barrel - whereas the average low for Iran, Iraq, and Saudi Arabia is around US$2.00 per barrel,” he said. “The NIOC estimates that crude oil production from this section could rise to 1.4 million barrels per day within the first five years of proper development and could be stabilised around that level, making it one of the biggest producing oil fields in the world,” he told OilPrice.com. “From the U.S.’s perspective, this would be extremely undesirable, given the current sanctions environment, especially as the output from this, along with most of the other output from the other two Arvand sites on Iran’s side, would go to China, to which effect Iran is offering China’s CNPC a discount of around US$4.50 per barrel,” he concluded."
China Scoops Up Cheap Nigerian Oil.html,"The submersion of East Asian markets into coronavirus-induced recession has pulled down several major oil producers, most notably Nigeria whose breakeven price is well above $100 per barrel (Fitch puts it at $144 per barrel). Depending on its crude production for 60% of government revenue, Nigeria was confronted with a double whammy of falling oil prices and general economic decline – to the extent that Lagos has applied for some 7 billion in SARS-COV-2-related emergency funds provided by the IMF and the World Bank. Nigeria’s credit ratings were downgraded by both S&P and Fitch (Moody’s kept the negative outlook without downgrading) and things seemed as if the most populous country in Africa might be in for some serious trouble. Part of the anxiety was due to the fact that Nigeria agreed to participate in the unprecedented Russia-Saudi Arabia-United States crude production curtailment and vowed to drop output levels by some 300kbpd to an overall level of 1.4mbpd (do not be confused by the ostensibly higher level of crude exports, Nigerian condensates are out of the question and will remain left out from the deal itself). The Nigerian Oil Ministry even went as far as to say that they expect 2.8 billion in additional revenue from being part of the OPEC+ deal. Initially, however, whilst Nigeria’s commitment to the deal entirely laudable, it seemed as if OPEC+ was removing only a fraction of barrels that entered the market. Graph 1. Nigeria’s Crude Exports in 2017-2020 (in million barrels per day).  Source: Thomson Reuters. Now Nigeria can finally let off a brief sigh of relief as the return of China has boosted both export prospects and grade differentials. Led by Saudi Arabia, leading Middle Eastern producers engaged in a hypercompetitive price war and despite most of West African crudes remaining one of the most optimal sources for IMO 2020-compliant products, Nigerian crudes struggled to reach their traditional market outlets in Asia. The intense price pressure has rendered West African remarkably attractive after it drove them to multi-year lows – even IMO 2020 favorites like the Equitorial-Guinean Zafiro or Chadian Doba went as low as -7 against Dated Brent, not to speak of the manifold light sweet grades West Africa wields.
 Chinese buyers would generally buy only 1-2 cargoes from Nigeria yet boosted by the economic profitability of West African countries in April there were 4 vessels sailing off for China and the May 2020 tally went even further to a whopping 7 cargoes, totaling 9 MMbbls. Interestingly, both April and May witnessed an Egina cargo loading for China, despite it being a staple diet of Northwest European refiners. This reconfiguration of the usual state of things (albeit temporary) is partially due to the fact that Indian demand, routinely the largest magnet for Nigerian grades, has subsided somewhat as the SARS-COV-2-induced lockdown took place there with a delay of several months. All this means that Nigerian cargoes arriving to China this June will mark the highest-ever level, whilst West African exports to China will be the highest since November 2018.  Related: Will There Be Another Oil Price War? As impressive as the Nigerian export surge to China seems, it would not have happened without extremely depressed grade differentials. The combination of Middle Eastern producers cutting OSPs and the coronavirus demand slump has elicited an unprecedented drop in Nigerian differentials – from March to April (the OSPs are usually published around the 15th of the preceding months) almost every single grade has witnessed a $4-5 per barrel month-on-month decline. Moreover, differentials were plummeting even harder in terms of real market prices (since OSPs play a largely indicative role) – after most flagship Nigerian grades moved to discounts against Dated Brent in March, it took them more than a month to bottom out in the $-7/-9 per barrel interval to Dated. Graph 2. West African Crude Exports to China in 2018-2020 (in million barrels per day).  Source: Thomson Reuters. The official selling prices of Nigerian grades present a fairly truthful picture of their current pricing levels. If the OSPs of light sweet, predominantly IMO 2020-compliant, Nigerian grades drop in May 2020 to $-3 or even $-4 per barrel against Dated Brent, the lowest ever recorded, then surely something is not right. Yet as the June OSPs start to transpire one can see that a bounce back of differentials is already taking place, Nigeria’s flagship export streams like Bonny Light or Qua Iboe are both assessed at $-1.05 per barrel to Dated, with the rest moving even stronger towards a flat Brent assessment. As Europe comes back from a multi-month lockdown season, it will rediscover its appetite for West African crudes, hence the probability of the Nigerian export surge to China becoming a long-term trend (especially with the strengthening diffs) is shrinking.
 Graph 3. Nigerian Official Selling Prices in 2017-2020 (against Dated Brent).  Source: NNPC. Nigeria’s way forward will not be easy – its exports possibilities will be subdued for a couple of months by its participation in OPEC+, all its differentials will not go back to pre-corona territory that easily. This will be especially true of high-gasoline-yield very light grades, whilst grades with a more balanced mid-distillate yield should become the best performers of this summer. Nigerian exporters would also need to keep in mind the risk of increased competition – to name just one example, the Indian refiner IOC has awarded in a recent purchase tender in May to the American WTI although almost everyone expected it to buy Nigerian."
Saudi Arabia Wants Record Oil Output Cuts To Last Till End 2020.html,"Saudi Arabia and several other members of OPEC are discussing the possibility of extending the current level of OPEC+ production cuts to the end of the year to support the market, but Russia could be the stumbling block again, Reuters reported on Thursday, citin8ug sources at OPEC+ and i9Russia’s oil industry.   The OPEC+ group pledged in April production restrictions of 9.7 million bpd in May and June, before easing the cuts to 7.7 million bpd for July through December. According to Reuters’ sources, Saudi Arabia would like to see the deeper 9.7-million-bpd cut extended through the end of 2020 to rebalance the market. OPEC and the OPEC+ group are expected to meet via teleconference on June 9 and 10 to discuss the market fundamentals and possible tweaks to the deal they forged in April to cut nearly 10 percent of global oil production to support the market while demand is weak during the pandemic.
 “The Saudis see that the market still needs support and want to roll over the same cuts until end of the year. The Russians also want the same but the problem again is with the oil companies,” a source at OPEC+ told Reuters. Russia, in its typical ‘wait-and-see’ approach, is non-committal and reportedly prefers to wait to see how much oil demand will recover. Earlier this week, Russia’s Energy Minister Alexander Novak discussed with oil executives the possible extension of the current oil production cuts beyond June.  Related: U.S. Hydropower Disaster Causes $1 Billion In Damages According to a source familiar with the details of the meeting who spoke to Reuters, Russia’s oil companies failed to reach any agreement at the Tuesday meeting, as half of the firms supported the extension of the current cuts—which means Russia cutting production from around 11 million bpd to 8.5 million bpd—while the other half of the oil executives were against extending the deep cuts and calling for the easing of the cuts, as per the OPEC+ agreement.
 Russia plans to stick to the OPEC+ deal reached in April and ease the cuts after June 30, Russian officials and industry sources told Bloomberg on Wednesday. Meanwhile, Russia’s President Vladimir Putin had a telephone conversation with Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on Wednesday, during which “Both sides noted the importance of the joint efforts to reach the OPEC+ agreements on reducing oil production in April. They agreed to continue close coordination on this issue between the energy ministries,” the Kremlin said. "
US Shale Production Wont Bounce Back Until 2021.html,"It could take a year before U.S. shale production starts to rise again, the chief executive of Precision Drilling Kevin Neveu told Bloomberg. This could happen even if a hypothetical second wave of Covid-19 infections has a milder effect on the U.S. economy than the first one, and even if the economy rebounds, Neveu noted. However, it is U.S. shale that will lead the recovery in the wider oil industry, he also said. “They’re [shale oil producers] taking it on the chin right now, and certainly production is slowing down and activity is slowing down, but it’s so quick and so easy to get that production flowing again that I think it will be one of the first places the E&P companies go,” Neveu told Bloomberg.
 This is what has happened before when supply has tightened and prices have risen, during the last oil price crisis in 2014-2016. Chances are that it will happen again. When it will happen remains the open question. “Getting back to 800 rigs in the U.S. is plausible,” according to Neveu. “If oil prices were in the US$60 to US$70 range, it could back to where it was pre COVID-19 and pre-Russia-Saudi price war.” For oil prices to get back to pre-crisis levels we would need to see significantly improved demand and lower supply. For now, there is a better chance for the latter than the former, and this is without factoring in a second wave of Covid-19 infections. This is simply because a lot is being done to shrink supply, yet there is little that can be done to stimulate demand.
 The number of active rigs in the U.S. last week was 318, Baker Hughes reported last Friday. That’s down by 21 rigs from the previous weeks and 665 rigs lower than this time last year."
Oil Prices Fall On Bearish EIA Data23667.html,"The Energy Information poured cold water on oil bull circles this week when it reported a crude oil inventory increase of 7.9 million barrels for the week to May 22. Fuel inventories posted mixed results, with gasoline down and distillate fuels up. This compares with an inventory draw of 5 million barrels a week earlier and analyst expectations for a draw of 2.5 million barrels. The EIA reported a modest draw in gasoline inventories, at 700,000 barrels, which compared with a build of 2.8 million barrels a week earlier. Gasoline production, the EIA said, averaged 7.2 million bpd last week, slightly up from the previous week.
 In distillate fuels, the EIA reported an inventory increase of 5.5 million barrels for the week to May 22, after a sizeable build of 3.8 million barrels for the previous week. This, in turn, followed a weekly inventory build of 3.5 million barrels. Distillate fuel production last week averaged 4.8 million bpd, almost unchanged on a week earlier. U.S. refineries processed an average 13 million bpd last week, slightly more than the previous week. This compared with 12.9 million bpd a week earlier, signaling the accelerating, but still slow recovery in oil demand in the world’s largest consumer as states reopen and economic activity begins to recover, too. There are many doubts about how long it would take for the U.S. economy—and other large economies—to rebound to pre-pandemic levels and there is also a big question about oil demand. In fact, even some industry executives don’t see that rebounding fully to pre-crisis levels. However, for now, any positive news about oil consumption would have an immediate effect on a market starved of good news for weeks.
 At the time of writing, West Texas Intermediate was trading at $32.85 a barrel with Brent crude at $34.66, both down after Wednesday reports that Russia may be considering easing its production cuts from July. The current OPEC+ production cuts stand at 9.7 million bpd, to be in effect until the end of June. There have also been reports the group may discuss extending them beyond that expiry date."
Will There Be Another Oil Price War.html,"Two months ago, Russia said no to Saudi Arabia's proposal for deeper oil production cuts. It was enough to start a price war that, coinciding with the Covid-19 pandemic, wiped out billions in oil revenues for both Russia and Saudi Arabia while forcing them to enact even deeper cuts than previously discussed. Some say the price war was never about Saudi Arabia and Russia. They say it was about U.S. shale. If that is accurate, what happens when the U.S. shale patch regains enough strength to start ramping up production again?  It might sound premature to talk about production ramp-ups with West Texas Intermediate still below $40 a barrel and likely to stay below this crucial mark for a while. But eventually, prices will hit the mark: shale producers have cut a solid chink of their output, demand is improving, and not least, bankruptcies are already underway with more to come. In fact, as many as 250 U.S. shale companies could go under, according to Rystad Energy, unless prices improve markedly and quickly. Gulf-focused business journalist Frank Kane wrote for the Arab News that the next price war is just a few dollars per barrel away. These few dollars would motivate producers to start increasing their production. ""It would make no sense at all for Saudi Arabia to continue with its market-changing cuts, which are exacting a big price in terms of lost revenue, if the U.S. was swamping the world with oil again,"" Kane wrote, adding that, ""The battle for market share — with the Kingdom turning the pumps full throttle again — would be back on.""  Related: Will U.S. Shale Survive If Oil Hits $40?
 Saudi Arabia recorded a budget deficit of $9 billion for the first quarter of the year, with revenues down 22 percent during the period on the back of the oil price slump. Aramco's profit for the quarter fell by 25 percent. The Kingdom started issuing bonds on the international market to stabilize its finances as it bled foreign reserves at the fastest rate in 20 years, according to Reuters, as it fought the double blow of low oil prices, weak demand, and the Covid-19 pandemic. Meanwhile, Russia reported a budget surplus for the first quarter, albeit a modest one, at 0.5 percent. It maintained the surplus in April as well, but now it seems that the pandemic has started to take a toll, with Finance Minister Anton Siluanov telling local media that the government planned to increase borrowing and delay some national-scale projects until the economy recovers. The minister forecast a 5-percent GDP decline for the year thanks to oil price developments and the pandemic. Economically speaking, the immediate outlook for the U.S. economy is grimmer than that for Saudi Arabia or Russia, with the second-quarter GDP seen by some as posting a double-digit decline, and a hefty one at that, at up to 40 percent. The U.S. oil industry is not such a big part of the United States' GDP as it is for Russia or Saudi Arabia, but unlike Russia or Saudi Arabia, the U.S. oil industry can hardly rely on government aid. In fact, the American Petroleum Institute has spoken against such aid. So, let's say a couple of hundred U.S. shale drillers go bust because of the prolonged price depression. This will coincide with gradual demand improvement as lockdowns go away, and barring a second wave of Covid-19 infections, this demand improvement will push prices up. As this happens, the surviving shale drillers, most of them debt-laden, will have no choice but to start pumping more.   Related: Oil Slides As Russia Plans To Raise Production What will Russia and the Saudis do then?
 Russia has said it could live on cheap Brent for years as long as ""cheap"" means no less than $40 a barrel. Saudi Arabia needs twice that to break even. But does it need to break even? There are many countries living in comfort with budget deficits, and the United States is—or was prior to the pandemic—by far the best example. Saudi Arabia's Finance Minister recently said the economy of the Kingdom was solid enough to withstand the effects of low oil prices. If this is true, then it would probably be solid enough to endure another round of maximum production, which would be the only response to rising U.S. production that would make sense for Saudi Arabia. Of course, there is an optimistic scenario: demand improves so fast that everyone is happy with prices. Indeed, according to Russia's Energy Minister, supply and demand could rebalance within two months now that production cuts have reached as much as 15 million bpd. This, Alexander Novak said, means that the current supply surplus has shrunk to 7-12 million bpd.  Now, all we need is to wait and see how quickly demand recovers, because there are doubts, including within the oil industry, that it might never recover to pre-crisis levels."
Have Oil Traders Abandoned Fundamentals.html,"Oil prices are back at levels last seen in mid-March, and while fundamentals for crude have improved somewhat, markets have become too optimistic Market euphoria continues to push financial markets and commodities higher, and oil prices have climbed back to levels not seen since lockdown orders in the U.S. began in March. By a variety of metrics, markets have recently made up a lot of lost ground over the past two and a half months. The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged past 25,000 points on Tuesday, and the S&P 500 jumped above 3,000. Both thresholds were last reached in March. WTI rose above $34 per barrel on Tuesday, another two-and-a-half month high. “For Economy, Worst of Coronavirus Shutdowns May Be Over,” a Wall Street Journal headline blared, citing an array of hopeful statistics on hotel spending, restaurant bookings and airline traffic. But the gap between the stock market and the real economy continues to widen. Over 38 million people have filed for unemployment. Corporate bankruptcies have begun to accelerate, even as the worst lies ahead. A real estate crisis is brewing in both corporate and residential sectors, with millions of people and thousands of businesses unable to pay rent and mortgages.
 In the oil market, improving sentiment has at least some basis in fundamentals. Rystad Energy estimates that the oil market was oversupplied by around 16 million barrels per day (mb/d) in April, a massive overhang that forced prices into negative territory. The rapid shut in of around 12 mb/d (largely shouldered by OPEC+) has erased a huge portion of the surplus. The widely-publicized rebound in demand – of around 4 mb/d, according to Rystad – puts the market close to “balanced” in June. However, again, there is a disconnect between sentiment and the current state of the market. Oil prices are back at levels last seen in mid-March, prior to the shutdown of the economy. “We find it hard to justify why prices are where they were on 11 March,” Standard Chartered wrote in a note on Tuesday. “We do not think expectations about the future have brightened significantly since this date.” The investment bank noted that the IEA’s projection for global demand in March was a slight decline of just 90,000 bpd for 2020. Now, the agency’s estimate is for demand to decline by 8.63 mb/d, “96 times more than the estimate on 11 March,” Standard Chartered pointed out. And yet, oil prices are trading in the mid-$30s, just as they were in March.  Related: Morgan Stanley Expects $40 Brent By Christmas Supply curtailments have erased much of the glut, but a supply-driven correction means that production can come back online as soon as prices rise to tolerable levels. That, in turn, means that prices are capped to a large degree. “Had the market owed its strength to upside surprises in demand, it could continue past USD 40/bbl with renewed strength,” Standard Chartered said. Instead, the surge in prices is because of supply shut ins, which can quickly be reversed. The bank estimates that the U.S. could bring 2 mb/d back online with WTI between $30 and $35. And with Brent at $40, the durability of the OPEC+ agreement starts to come into question. As such, “we think the rally is running on fumes,” Standard Chartered said.
 “We also do not think that expectations about the global economy have brightened since 11 March, nor have expected timelines for any putative vaccine or return to previous economic conditions shortened,” Standard Chartered warned. Meanwhile, a second wave of infections remains very possible. In fact, the rate of coronavirus infections is on the rise in at least 12 U.S. states. Rural parts of the U.S. are suffering from the latest surge in cases. Also, the pandemic is only now beginning to explode in places like Brazil and India. It has yet to work its way through much of the world – and could return to previously hit areas that are now reopening. “[O]verall, the demand backdrop does not justify a return to anywhere near 11 March prices, in our view,” Standard Chartered concluded. And yet, to much fanfare, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo rang in the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday, marking the reopening of the exchange’s trading floor. Stocks surged in response."
Oil Slides On Russias Plans To Raise Production.html,"Reports that Russia plans to start easing oil production cuts after the end of June arrested the oil price rally, keeping WTI below $35 a barrel. WTI slid 0.3 percent following the news, after gaining more than 3 percent yesterday. This added to worry about U.S.-Chinese relations after the U.S. threatened to impose sanctions on China for its policy towards Hong Kong. The Bloomberg report, which cites unnamed sources familiar with Moscow’s position on the cuts, stands in stark contrast with a Reuters report, which also cited unnamed people familiar with the Russian position, who said Moscow was in fact considering an extension of the current cuts.
 Russia is meeting with its OPEC+ partners next month to discuss future steps, with Energy Minister Alexander Novak saying that he expected the oil market to rebalance by July. The remark suggests Russia might indeed be ready to ease the cuts, which have capped its production at 8.5 million bpd. On the other hand, there are way too many questions around the rate of demand improvement for comfort, so extending the production cuts is certainly on the table. According to reports from last week, Russia is almost complying with its share of the cuts, with its crude oil production averaging 8.72 million bpd in the first three weeks of May, as per Reuters estimates. This is close to the 8.5-million-bpd quota, especially considering Russia’s far-from-perfect track record in complying with the cuts. In a separate positive sign for oil markets, Bloomberg noted that Nigeria and Algeria had increased their official selling oil prices, indicating they expected improved demand soon.
 Meanwhile, demand is recovering in two key markets: China and India. India’s Energy Minister Dharmendra Pradhan said demand for oil would rebound to pre-crisis levels next month while in China, IHS Markit said it expected May demand to reach 92 percent of pre-crisis levels."
5 Points To Consider Before Buying Oil Stocks In 2020.html,"If you are among those who are somewhat contrarian in nature and are ready to rush in and buy oil and gas stocks when they are down, downturns like this can be a great time to do so. But you really need to know what you are buying and what questions to ask your broker in order to give yourself a realistic chance of financial success. Not all public oil and gas company stocks are created equal. In other words, there is a difference between not following the crowd and “true value investing”. Another very important issue to consider is the publicly traded oil company’s booked reserves which may never be produced and how secure are they. These are called Proved Undeveloped Reserves. This article is designed to point out some very key and crucial points that you should know which could cause the stock’s value to be suppressed for quite some time. There are those investors who are aware of the issues discussed herein and know how to take calculated risks, but many do not, so this discussion is for those who don’t, especially when it comes to understanding the dynamics surrounding Proved Undeveloped Reserves and how they can affect stock value. Since the history-making plunge in oil prices on April 20, 2020, the Internet has been full of opportunities to “buy now” when oil prices and stock prices are down. Whether you are just planning to sell the stock at some point in time in the near future to realize a quick profit or if you are looking to hold on to it in hopes of realizing future cash dividend payments, it is important you know the answers to the following. For example: 1. Do you fully understand what determines the true value in the stock you are buying? 2. What are Proved Undeveloped Reserves and how do they affect stock values? 3. Do you know how the new 2008 SEC ruling regarding Proved Undeveloped Reserves can affect your investment? 4. How does the “breakeven price point” of booked reserves affect the company’s cash dividends? 5. At what oil and gas commodity price should you buy in at and at what price are the company’s reserves valued? Do you fully understand what determines “true value” in the stock you are buying? Publicly traded companies can book reserves that look good on paper, but they may never be produced. It is important for you, the investor, to know exactly which reserves actually put true value into the company, not just in their annual report that increases the stock price. For example, companies generally try to place each of several categories of “Proved Reserves” on their balance sheet. But, does each category represent a realistic value? For example, there are three different “Proved Reserve categories” in which the SEC allows a company to place on its bottom-line value. These are: Proved Developed Producing (PDP) - current oil and gas production and reservoir analysis of ultimate recovery from existing wells (i.e. current cash flow). Proved Developed Non-Producing (PDNP) - oil and gas that has been verified in existing wells, but not yet producing. Commonly called “newly drilled and completed and not online” or proven ""behind pipe reserves"" which can fit the description of PUD reserves in that these types of reserves (behind the pipe) may never be produced any time soon, if ever due to many unforeseen circumstances, such as oil and gas prices and future available cash for the CAPEX attributable to recovering these “behind the pipe” reserves. Proved Undeveloped (PUD) - oil and gas that may be recovered from new development wells on undrilled acreage completed in the same geological formation as the existing direct offset wells (requires substantial Capital Expenditures for drilling new wells). According to the Oil and Gas Financial Journal, “the primary determinants in assessing the true value of an oil and gas company are, at the time of valuation: 1) reserves, 2) level of production, and 3) commodity price at the time of valuation.” While the level of production, and commodity price at the time of valuation variables are relatively straightforward to determine, the question of how best to measure a company’s reserve stocks remains somewhat questionable at best due to the vast number of extenuating factors. But all of these Proved Reserve categories have risks. For example, if you only look at the PDP reserves (the company’s cash flow) for its true value, then the rise and fall of daily oil and gas prices can affect the company’s ability to “breakeven” in price downturns, such as is 2Q 2020, thus lowering the company’s overall bottom-line value. Calculating a total “breakeven” amount includes many costs such things as, lease operating expenses, production tax, return on capital expenditures (CAPEX), servicing bank debt, making payroll, accommodating associated admin/overhead costs, and other contractual obligations. One especially problematic issue for investors is the acquisition of properties that are under contracts negotiated when oil and gas prices were higher but have not closed and that are due to close soon after a significant oil and gas price drop. In this all too common scenario, the value of the property to be acquired is to be out of balance with current pride conditions and closing will take away from the company’s most precious commodity – cash. Most of the time, investors are not aware of any such “land mine” contractual acquisition obligations. As we are seeing in 2Q 2020, many companies are scrambling to readjust their admin/overhead costs so they can at least pay the monthly lease operating costs and service their bank debt in order to keep these PDP reserves alive. But, with PDP reserves, they are only as good as profit margins. That is why the SEC allows the other ‘proved reserves’ to be booked as value such as PUD reserves. What are Proved Undeveloped Reserves (PUD)? As previously stated, Proved Undeveloped Reserves (PUD) quantify oil and gas that will be recovered on undrilled acreage from new development wells completed in the same geological formation as the existing, direct offset wells (requires substantial Capital Expenditures for drilling new wells). A good question to ask is what price point has been placed on these reserves. You’ll notice a key point in the definition: Oil and gas reserves that “will be recovered from new development wells on undrilled acreage”. The question is, when will they be recovered, if ever? Another important consideration is what was the price point used at the time that the PUD reserves were booked. In other words, were the economics a snapshot in time rather than future planning if prices dropped. In such cases, it may not be economic in the future to develop the PUD reserves and it may never be, which could also cause the loss of their associated oil and gas leases. In the 1980’s many companies lost their PUD locations due to the non-drilling of the term leases in which those PUD reserves were associated with. Further, these PUD reserves require substantial Capital Expenditures to be fully realized. The question here is: What if there is no capital to expand? Another concern is whether or not this “undrilled acreage” is held by current production from the existing PDP wells (HBP) or are they term leases that could expire because they are not HBP. In addition, another real issue regarding this HBP leasehold where the PUD evaluations are listed is if those leases are subject to being lost due to a ‘depth clause’ and/or ‘Pugh clause’. In other words, after a certain period of time, a ‘depth clause’ in the lease allows ownership of formations not being produced (according to their spacing unit size) to revert from the company as Lessee back to the Lessor, which devalues those PUD reserves.
 There are two types of ‘depth clauses which should concern the investor, either “deepest depth drilled” or “deepest producing formation”:  Related: The State Of Texas Collected Huge Royalty Check Before Price Crash deepest depth drilled - “It is hereby understood and agreed that at the end of the primary term hereof, or any renewal or extension hereof, unless this lease is being otherwise maintained as provided for herein, this lease shall expire as to all depths lying below the stratigraphic equivalent of 100’ below the base of the deepest depth drilled of any well drilled on the leased premises or on lands pooled therewith.” and deepest producing formation - “It is hereby understood and agreed that at the end of the primary term hereof, or any renewal or extension hereof, unless this lease is being otherwise maintained as provided for herein, this lease shall expire as to all depths lying below the stratigraphic equivalent of 100’ below the base of the deepest producing formation of any well drilled on the leased premises or on lands pooled therewith.” The same goes for the Pugh clause, which allows for all undrilled spacing units to revert back to the Lessor. For example, the company has a PDP well on a lease covering 640 acres which is spaced on 160 acres for that well (one well per 160 acres). The Pugh clause in the lease states something like: “Beyond the Primary Term of the Oil and Gas Lease, absent any provision that would otherwise maintain the entire Lease in full force and effect, the lease will expire as to all acreage not included in a producing unit.” The main critical issue regarding PUD values is the company’s ability or inability to maintain the associated leasehold while waiting for new wells to be drilled and then “hold” (or extend) the leased acreage by production, thus still holding this future value in place. For these and other reasons which are not always known to investors in a company’s stock, PUD values are the riskiest of the three Proved Reserve categories. Do you know how the new 2008 SEC ruling regarding Proved Undeveloped Reserves can affect your investment? The author is not an expert on SEC matters, but through research found that according to the SEC’s definition of Proved Undeveloped Reserves prior to 2008, PUD’s were described was: “Those quantities of crude oil, natural gas, NGLs and condensate, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with certainty to be economically producible—from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing conditions, operating methods, and government regulations—prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation.” In 2008, the SEC published a proposed rule called “Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting”. After receiving comments during an extensive rulemaking process, the final rule became effective on January 1, 2010 (161 pages, compete with historical background and industry guidance). You may see the final rule here. These revised rules for oil and gas reserve disclosures further defined the requirements for “proved reserves” in the hopes of giving investors and shareholders a more accurate understanding of a company’s current assets. According to the SEC, proved reserves are defined as the estimated quantities of oil and gas anticipated to be economically producible, as of a given date, under existing economic and operating conditions. Proved reserves can be defined as both developed or undeveloped in oil and gas that has been verified in current wells, but not yet producing which includes PUD’s, which is oil & gas that will be recovered from new development wells on undrilled acreage in the same geological formation as the direct offset wells (requires Capital Expenditures for new wells categories). While oil and gas companies historically included PUD quantities within their annual financial disclosures, the 2008 rule goes a step further by broadening the terms under which a company could list undeveloped reserves as “proved” for both shareholders and potential investors. While the new SEC regulations do not change this risk structure, they do give companies greater leeway in booking PUD reserves than they had prior to 2010. The finalized definition of PUD reserves removed the previous “certainty” test that was required for reserves to be considered PUD reserves and replaced it with a “reasonable certainty” test. What does this slight shift in language mean to PUD reserve values? Simply put, companies that would previously be required to invest capital in exploration drilling to meet PUD standards now can rely on both deterministic—involving actual drilling—and probabilistic methods to estimate PUD reserves. Importantly, this new description change also allows the use of evidence—economic data, drilling statistics, and geoscience—gathered from reliable technology to meet the reasonable certainty test of economic producibility for lease parcels further removed from currently productive units, rather than just those units immediately adjacent to productive wells. Essentially, the area from which companies can estimate and book proved reserves was drastically increased as a result of the new rules, which in turn makes them riskier in nature and less likely to show real value. As a result, the revised 2008 SEC guidelines have provided the oil and gas industry with what could be considered a regulatory windfall. Thanks to the loosened requirements on PUD estimates, companies now have both an opportunity to report on these risky reserves while also increasing the levels booked on their annual reports to shareholders and investors. But if the revised SEC regulations now provide companies with added flexibility to report on these distinct reserve classes, the degree to which these assets affect the company’s current and future value remains unclear unless other factors are considered. For example, what is the company’s Breakeven Price Points in the area of these PDP and PUD reserves. To explore this, the author considers the three scenarios listed above and examines to what degree reserve levels—both developed and, more importantly, undeveloped—affect a company’s total valuation and its leasing practices. The bottom line is that, following the enactment of the revised 2008 SEC guidelines, some analysts predicted there would likely be an increase in booked PUD reserves across the industry. Because the new regulation loosened the requirements around establishing reserves as proved to include probabilistic methods, companies no longer needed to sink large amounts of upfront capital into exploration and drilling in order to book new PUD reserves.  How does the “breakeven price point” of booked reserves affect the company’s cash dividends? In the post – 2010 SEC reporting scenario, investors looking for “true value” must address the effect “breakeven” price point of booked reserves will have on the company’s cash dividends. A simple answer is that ‘profits’ generate cash dividends. In other words, a cash dividend is funds or money paid to stockholders generally as part of the corporation's current earnings or accumulated profits. The board of directors must declare the issuing of all dividends and decide if the dividend payment can reinvest their dividends. Most brokers offer a choice to reinvest or accept cash dividends. In a previous article I wrote for Oilprice.com dated January 4, 2018, I mention the importance of establishing safe ‘breakeven price points.” The term “safe” refers to the ability to operate and maintain leases during down pricing scenarios because the revenue from a given property at the low pride point still exceeds the total costs for Acquisition, CAPEX, Lease Operating Expense, and Production Tax. are present, while at the same time generate a profit.  Related: Oil Holds Gains As Demand Continues To Rise
 For example, in 2Q 2020, if a company is able to operate and still make a good profit from any given property, then they had to initially set their price points for Acquisition, CAPEX, Lease Operating and Production Tax of that property at a lower level below the current actual price point. And, for the company to be profitable, their total revenue from all producing properties had to exceed the breakeven price points of all their producing properties. An example of this could be taken from what oil yearly average oil prices have done since 1974 (PetroDollar) through 2019 and dividing that by half ($36.39/2 = $18.19). This $18.19 figure is not far-fetched when you consider the second chart where the yearly average oil price during this same time period was below this 49-year average 65% of the time for a price of near $20 per barrel. Unfortunately, according to a report from the Federal Reserve Bank in Dallas dated March 2020, the average breakeven price point for the country is a little less than $50 per barrel ($49.17), which equates to companies not being able to develop their PUD reserves during downturns like those seen today (April-May 2020) thus further risking the non-HPB leases to expire and a loss of booked PUD values.   So, more awareness on the investor’s part is to thoroughly research these breakeven price points and ask your stock advisor to assist you in order to better assess the ability of realizing true achievable value from these types of reserves.  What oil and gas price do you buy in at? Have you heard people say, “I will wait to invest when prices go back up?” A couple of questions and a comment: What price would they consider safe? What did they base that answer on? If they invest after prices go back up, then they are setting themselves up for failure. History has repeatedly shown us that sharp price declines are followed by declines in drilling and completions costs which allow for lower breakeven price points. Conversely, increasing oil and gas prices are closely followed by higher drilling and completion costs which can ultimately lead to higher breakeven price points. The obvious answer to the question of when to buy in is to buy when oil and gas prices are their lowest. But, in order to make “safe” investments during low pride scenarios, you must have the ability to select a realistic breakeven price point which will work throughout the anticipated time frame of your investment (for example, half of the yearly average oil and gas prices from 1974-2019, as shown above). These types of investments may be hard to find. But perseverance and patience will allow you to locate these opportunities. Generally, your small to mid-size companies have much lower overhead costs. If you got interested in the oil and gas business after 2005, you may not know that in 1998, oil traded for the year at an average price of $11.91 per barrel. I was involved with a company during that time in Santa Barbara, California that had breakeven price points at $4 per barrel. This unusually low breakeven price point allowed the company to be very aggressive in adding additional properties to their portfolio at a time when other companies were selling because the revenue from the low prices did not cover their operating expenses (CAPEX, Lease Operating Expense, and Production Tax). In addition, you may not know that the following yearly average oil prices are actually less than you might expect. These figures represent the number of times these yearly average prices have occurred in the history of the oil and gas business (1859 – 2019) and the percentage of time from 1974 - 2019. $ 40 per barrel – 15 times = 34% $ 50 per barrel – 12 times = 27% $ 60 per barrel –  9 times = 20% $ 70 per barrel –  6 times = 13% $ 80 per barrel –  5 times = 11% $ 90 per barrel –  2 times =  4% $100 per barrel – 0 times =  0% In summary, pick your ‘buy in price’ wisely. The associated breakeven price points of the company you are interested in along with their overvaluing of PUDs can cripple your ability to make money. Are there any companies that have this ‘magic bullet’ formula? Yes, you just have to know how to find them or ask your stockbroker the questions I have proposed in this article. And, if you rely on a stockbroker or other investment advisor, then you should insist they understand these principles and get you the information which answers the questions raised in this article. Conclusion This article explores the potential risks and financial rewards for investors in oil and gas companies who book PUD properties, while at the same time delay the development of these reserves from those same properties. By highlighting the different scenarios described above, this author suggests that E&P companies do, in fact, seek to gain financially from both the increase in Proved Developed Reserves (those that are produced and sold to market) as well as Proved Undeveloped Reserves (PUD) that may never make it out of the ground. However, sufficient evidence exists to show that the current regulatory model for oil and gas reserves reporting is inadequate; it allows the stock price of a publicly-traded company to benefit from the PUD reserves they have booked, but without fairly disclosing to investors the factors which make it uneconomic to ever develop and bring those PUD reserves to market and at the expense of the public through nondevelopment of these PUD reserves."
Permian Drillers Resilient Despite Record Breaking Rig Count Crash.html,"Although the Covid-19 pandemic continues to decimate active horizontal rigs in the US, the Permian Basin is emerging as the last surviving epicenter of drilling activity, a Rystad Energy analysis of Baker Hughes data shows. The total horizontal oil rig count fell to 218 rigs last week, a 65% decline from the peak of 624 rigs seen in the middle of March 2020. Horizontal gas drilling was down to 67 rigs last week, which is 56% below the previous peak seen in June 2019. Rig count is widely considered to be one of the most important indicators of investment appetite by E&Ps. Not only does it illustrate the actual drilling activity in the market, but it is also a key metric of consumer confidence, closely related to price developments. Two fundamental activity trends persist. The Permian has systematically increased its market share in nationwide horizontal oil drilling, reaching 74% as of last week, while gas-focused drilling has increased its market share in total horizontal activity, taking up a 23.5% of the drilling pie. “The current 65% cumulative decline will likely widen further as we still expect around 50 additional horizontal oil rigs may be lost in the next few weeks,” says Artem Abramov, Rystad Energy’s Head of Shale Research.
  The horizontal oil rig count decline rates are getting shallower, with the two-week decline rate moderating to 18.7%, down from the 25.6% rate seen three weeks ago. Yet the cumulative decline from peak-activity has set another record. In the two previous downturns in 2015 and 2016, cumulative decline only reached 53% to 54% before recovery was initiated. The number of counties with active horizontal oil drilling, meaning that they have at least one rig active, fell to 42 in the US, with 25 in Texas and 15 in the Permian. A closer look at county-level trends reveals that it is, in fact, two major counties in the whole of the Permian which have exhibited relative resilience in activity – Eddy County with only a 28% decline from peak activity, and Midland County with a 48% decline from peak activity.  Related: Turkey Headed For An Unexpected Victory Libya's Oil War
 All other major and mid-size counties have seen declines of more than 60% with some, such as Ward, Pecos, Andrews and Culberson, having lost 80% to 100% of their active rigs. The combined share of Eddy and Midland counties in basin-wide horizontal drilling has increased from 25% in the middle of March to 41% at present. Other liquid basins already exhibit much steeper cumulative rig activity declines. Eagle Ford stands out as having the shallowest cumulative decline of 70%. Horizontal rig activity in South Texas has declined from 80 rigs at the beginning of the year to “only” 24 rigs, largely thanks to ConocoPhillips’s decision to maintain robust drilling activity and build its drilled but uncompleted (DUC) wells inventory. The Bakken, SCOOP & STACK and the DJ basin lost 75% to 80% of their active rigs in the last 10 weeks, while activity in the Powder River Basin is down from 18 rigs to two. A gradual downward adjustment in horizontal gas rig activity has also continued. Most of the significant declines in the last few weeks have come from Marcellus, specifically from the southwestern portion of the basin. As of now, horizontal drilling activity in all major gas basins is observed at or below maintenance activity requirements and the potential from the DUC inventory has largely been depleted."
Russia Overtakes Saudi Arabia As The Largest Oil Exporter To China.html,"Russia became the top crude oil supplier to China last month, overtaking Saudi Arabia with an average of 1.75 million bpd versus 1.26 million bpd for Saudi Arabia, Reuters has reported, citing customs data. In fact, last month Saudi Arabia fell to the third spot among Chinese oil suppliers, with Iraq taking number-two. This compares with 1.66 million bpd of Russian oil imports in March and 1.7 million bpd of Saudi oil imports, A comparison of the monthly averages shows a substantial decline in Saudi oil supplies to the world’s top importer. At the same time, China’s March intake of Russian crude was 31 percent higher than a year earlier, and the April imports from Russia were 18 percent higher than a year earlier. According to TankerTrackers.com data, Saudi Arabia exported 2.083 million bpd of crude to China in April, up from 1.065 million bpd in March. An issue that creates confusion, there is a difference between exported and imported crude shipments because of the different times when a shipment is logged as exported and when it is logged as imported into the target country. According to TankerTrackers.com co-founder Samir Madani, this difference for Saudi Arabia and China is between two and four weeks.
 China is a key market for all crude oil exporters so it has naturally become a sort of battleground for the world’s top exporters given the rising tensions between Beijing and Washington, which are not exactly conducive to more U.S. imports of oil.  Related: Turkey Headed For An Unexpected Victory Libya's Oil War Meanwhile, in more good news for oil prices, China’s total oil imports for April were higher than they were in March, suggesting a stable recovery in oil demand. At 9.84 million bpd, the April average compared with 9.68 million bpd for March. The April figure, however, was lower than the average for April 2019, which stood at 10.64 million bpd. Analysts believe, however, that Saudi Arabia’s loss of market share to Russian oil is only temporary. Speaking to Bloomberg, ship-tracking company Vortexa said Saudi shipments of crude to China could more than double in May from April, when they fell by 41 percent from March.
 “It was clear that Saudi was targeting to increase its market share in the West during April,” IHS Markit regional head of commodities told Bloomberg. “Saudi is now reducing output and shipments, but is expected to focus on China again.” According to data from TankerTrackers.com for the first 21 days of May, Saudi shipments of oil for China averaged some 1.87 million bpd."
Russia Considers Extending Oil Output Cuts Beyond June.html,"Russia’s Energy Minister Alexander Novak is discussing with oil firms on Tuesday the possible extension of the current oil production cuts beyond June, sources with knowledge of the meeting’s agenda told Reuters. The OPEC+ group pledged in April production restrictions of 9.7 million bpd in May and June, before easing the cuts to 7.7 million bpd for July through December. As part of the OPEC+ deal, Russia pledged to cut its production to 8.5 million bpd in May and June from a February 2020 baseline, or by around 2 million bpd, or by 19 percent, from February 2020, Novak told Interfax in an interview last month. 
 The discussion of the possibility of extending the current level of cuts after June could be a sign that Russia is open to further support the rebalancing of the oil market after the price crash and coronavirus hit the economies of all oil-producing countries, including Russia. Russia has said it would hold regular meetings with its oil firms to take stock of the deal’s implementation, and today’s meeting is part of those regular updates. Earlier today, sources told Russian news agency Interfax that minister Novak would discuss the OPEC+ cuts with the top managers of the local oil firms. According to reports from last week, Russia is almost complying with its share of the cuts, with its crude oil production averaging 8.72 million bpd in the first three weeks of May, as per Reuters estimates. This is close to the 8.5-million-bpd quota, especially considering Russia’s far-from-perfect track record in complying with the cuts.
 Novak said on Monday that the market would rebalance by July, thanks to improving demand and quicker-than-expected production cuts from OPEC+ and from producers outside the pact. The effect of the OPEC+ deal is undoubtedly positive, Vladimir Putin’s Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov told Russian media on Tuesday, noting that largely thanks to the deal, the oil market avoided a much more negative scenario."
Oil Hedging Leaves Traders Dangerously Exposed.html,"Hedging is a popular trading strategy frequently used by oil and gas producers, airlines, and other heavy consumers of energy commodities to protect themselves against market fluctuations. During times of falling crude prices, oil producers normally use a short hedge to lock in oil prices if they believe prices are likely to go even lower in the future.  However, hedging is far from being a silver bullet that is guaranteed to protect oil producers from volatile markets, something U.S. shale producers understand only too well. Indeed, many are now unwilling to use this insurance after being slapped with hefty premiums thanks to hedging strategies that recently went awry.  Unfortunately, this also leaves them fully exposed to the risk of ultra-low prices in the future. Market Uncertainty Bloomberg has reported that only 50% of shale producers have hedged 2021 production compared to 60% that had done so at a comparable point last year. Many producers are finding themselves trapped in a Catch 22 situation. The current WTI price of $32/barrel is still way off the ~$50/barrel that many shale producers require to turn a profit. Hedging at this point would effectively mean foregoing any future price gains and guaranteeing yourself a loss. With production cuts so far working nicely, the recent storage crunch now in the back mirror and economies gradually emerging from lockdown, that appears like a rushed decision. On the other hand, this oil price rally appears to be running on fumes, and failing to hedge means risking even lower prices in the future. For instance, whereas the WTI June contract has rallied some 75% this month, WTI swap for 2021 has only climbed 10%. This essentially means that traders are very unsure whether the gains being made in the crude markets are here to stay.  Related: Oil Companies Forced To Renegotiate Deals Or Risk Losing It All The fact that half of U.S. shale producers have actually hedged 2021 production means that they consider there’s a high likelihood of prices sliding lower than current levels. However, they really don’t have much of a choice given that hedging is largely systemic in a bid to satisfy bank requirements coupled with their already high debt levels.
 That said, U.S. shale producers are partly to blame for their love for an overly ambitious hedging strategy. Three-Way Collars At the heart of the quagmire is a hedging strategy favored by U.S. producers known as three-way collars. These options tend to be a relatively cheap way to hedge against price fluctuations as long as prices remain range-bound. Indeed, collars are essentially costless, a big consideration at a time when expenses are being cut to the bone in a bid to survive. In theory, hedging allows producers to lock-in a certain price for their oil. The simplest way to do this is by buying a floor on the price using a put option then offsetting this cost by selling a ceiling using a call option. To trim costs even further, producers can sell what is commonly referred to as a subfloor, which is essentially a put option much lower than current oil prices. This is the three-way collar hedging strategy.  Source: Economic Times Three-way collars tend to work well when oil prices are moving sideways; however, they can leave traders exposed when prices fall too much as they recently did. Indeed, this strategy fell out of favor during the last oil crash of 2014 when prices fell too low, leaving shale producers counting heavy losses. Most producers turned back to the relatively safe fixed-price swaps but have increasingly been returning to three-way collars.  Related: Putin To Bail Out Russian Oil Industry Pioneer Natural Resources Co. (NYSE:PXD) is one such company. The company converted 85% of its crude derivatives into fixed-price swaps in the aftermath of the 2014 crash but started loading up on three-ways again in 2019.
 Over the last two years, Texas-based Denbury Resources Inc.(NYSE:DNR) has also been easing its swap positions in favor of three-way collars. Others that favor this strategy are Parsley Energy Inc. (NYSE:PE) and Occidental Corp. (NYSE:OXY). Huge Liquidity Squeeze Three-ways are a calculated bet that oil will only fall so low but not any further. The last tranche of three-ways mostly employed $45 a barrel was a popular strike level, below which producers became fully exposed. Obviously, this level was breached months ago. As Michael Tran, director of global energy strategy at RBC Capital Market, warned back in March, via Bloomberg: “When you look at three-way collars, given the volatile nature of this market, being knocked out of the market is always a viable threat depending on how quickly prices move. This is an insurance policy that isn’t always guaranteed.” Even more worrying is the fact that 2021 hedges are likely to reflect current market conditions, meaning producers will be lucky to get anywhere near $45/barrel. This means the vast majority of shale producers could start to feel a really huge liquidity squeeze in the coming year unless oil prices stage a strong recovery this year."
Shale Bust Hits Rural Communities As Oil Royalties Plunge.html,"The oil price collapse is hurting not only U.S. shale firms and their drilling activities. The crash has severely crippled the royalty payments to a dozen million American oil and gas royalty owners of land on which companies pump oil.  The value of the monthly checks to royalty owners in South Texas—home to the Eagle Ford shale play—has plummeted since the beginning of the year, due to the declining activity of oil firms which hastened to idle rigs after oil prices collapsed in early March, Reuters correspondent Jennifer Hiller reports.  Paul Ruckman, a royalty owner in DeWitt County, for example, has seen the value of royalty checks crumble by 70 percent since the beginning of the year. The value of those checks will further drop in coming months, Ruckman told Reuters.   The lower royalty income to residents in the oil communities in Texas and in other oil-producing states including North Dakota and Oklahoma is also diminishing household spending and tax revenues for the oil towns, putting further strain on the economy in these areas, on top of the effects of the layoffs in the industry and the coronavirus pandemic.  The regular paychecks to landowners across the U.S. shale patch have helped the local communities thrive when U.S. oil production was booming—royalty owners were funding local initiatives and counties were using oil money income to fund construction and repairs.  In DeWitt County, for example, during the 2018 boom, mineral values added $529 million to the county tax base “following a steady year of drilling and completions of Eagle Ford Shale wells,” the County said in its latest annual financial report for the year ended September 30, 2019. Overall, the county tax base rose by 13 percent, with the increase mostly attributable to growth in the mineral value component which grew to $3 billion. For the fiscal year 2020, the county was planning to repair county roads damaged by oil and gas activity and use tax revenue raised from mineral values to support the repairs. 
 Related: Driving Season Won’t Save Gas Demand The average owner of oil land has received around $500 per month in recent years, according to data from the National Association of Royalty Owners cited by Reuters. But the payments are expected to shrink in coming months.  As the oil price crash crushed royalty payments, landowners are bracing for months of very low paychecks from oil royalties and counties may suspend investments in revitalizing the communities.  The significantly lower oil royalty incomes for millions of American landowners come amid rising unemployment rate in the oil towns and counties as oil firms slash budgets, jobs, and drilling activities.  In April 2020, the Railroad Commission of Texas issued a total of 456 original drilling permits, including 416 permits to drill new oil or gas wells. To compare, in April last year, the Commission had issued double that number of drilling permits—909.    In the Midland district, the most active area in the Permian shale basin, the Commission issued 263 new drilling permits last month—down from 375 permits for Midland issued in March.  
 Unemployment rate in Midland jumped to 3.1 percent in March 2020 from 2.3 percent in February, according to U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. In DeWitt Country next to the Eagle Ford shale basin, the unemployment rate rose to 3.5 percent in March from 2.6 percent in February.  April and May unemployment data are expected to be much worse, considering the businesses battered by the COVID-19-related lockdowns and the collapsing drilling rig count across the U.S. shale patch.  In North Dakota, as of May 15, a total of 7,500 wells were shut-in for 510,000 bpd of shut-in production, according to the North Dakota Department of Mineral Resources. Active drilling rigs numbered just 14 on May 25, down from 65 active rigs on the same day last year.  Oil towns in North Dakota, Alaska, Wyoming, Texas, and Oklahoma are accustomed to the boom-and-bust nature of the oil industry. But this time around, the economic prospects and job losses are aggravated by the layoffs in the hospitality and entertainment industry during the lockdowns, and the oil towns and counties could take years to recover, officials fear. The crash in oil prices is also crushing the value of monthly paychecks that royalty owners collect from the oil industry.    "
The Risky Road To Oil Demand Recovery.html,"The IEA came out with a rather bullish remark for oil this morning, stating that peak demand is still years away. The agency’s chief Fatih Birol said that “In the absence of strong government policies, a sustained economic recovery and low oil prices are likely to take global oil demand back to where it was, and beyond,”. While there’s reason to be optimistic about the demand recovery in oil, given new data on oil consumption from China and the U.S., a full recovery could take much longer this time around compared to the 2008/2009 crisis.  The world’s two largest crude oil consumers, the U.S. and China, have both seen a rather quick recovery in gasoline demand, with the demand for distillates lagging a bit behind in the U.S.Bloomberg’s Javier Blas projected that U.S. gasoline demand was on course to reach 8 million barrels just ahead of memorial day weekend.  In the meantime, IHS Markit data suggests that China has seen oil demand bounce back even faster, with demand levels in April reaching 89 percent of April 2019 levels. Jim Burkhard, VP and head of oil markets at IHS Markit expects crude demand to reach 92 percent of May 2019 levels this month, stating that “The brisk resumption of Chinese oil demand, 90 percent of pre-COVID levels by the end of April and moving higher, is a welcome signpost for the global economy. When you consider that oil demand in China – the first country impacted by the virus – had fallen by more than 40 percent in February, the degree to which it is snapping back offers reason for some optimism about economic and demand recovery trends in other markets such as Europe and North America,”.

 In Europe, COVID-19 cases have peaked, and new hospitalizations and infections have declined in May, leading to the reopening of economies and an increase in road fuel consumption. Consultancy Rystad now estimates that total oil demand in Europe for 2020 is forecast to fall by 1.8 million bpd to 12.4 million bpd, a 13.2 percent decline from 2019’s 14.2 million bpd, and that total demand is set to recover to 13.6 million bpd in 2021, led by a recovery in road fuels. Whether the bounce in demand will prove sustainable is hard to say. Fears of a deep global depression and millions of layoffs are not unfounded. The magnitude of economic destruction is much greater than during the last crisis, and many fear that jobs that have been lost may not come back. 
 Researchers at the University of Chicago’s Becker Institute for Economics estimate that 42 percent of jobs could be permanently lost. The staggering number of job losses and the vast amount of companies that have shifted to a work-from-home environment could make it much harder for oil markets to recover.Looking at the IEA’s bullish message; before the pandemic struck, the agency said global petroleum consumption was likely to reach about 105 million barrels a day by 2030 and about 106 million by 2040 in the absence of new government policies. The agency may well have to adjust these numbers as oil demand growth over the next 5 years is unlikely to be significant given the long-term challenges for the industry."
IEA Peak Oil Demand Is Still Years Away.html,"The world hasn’t seen peak oil demand yet, the head of the International Energy Agency (IEA) told Bloomberg News on Monday, expecting that sooner or later, oil consumption would return to the pre-crisis levels and rise above that.   “In the absence of strong government policies, a sustained economic recovery and low oil prices are likely to take global oil demand back to where it was, and beyond,” Fatih Birol, Executive Director of the IEA, told Bloomberg. Birol’s assessment of oil demand trends for after the COVID-19 pandemic and recession could sound reassuring to major oil-producing nations that depend on oil revenues for their budgets, as well as to oil majors, some of which have expressed uncertainty whether oil demand will ever return to the 2019 levels.
 The pandemic adds not only a layer of uncertainty in the oil industry in the short term, but it also creates another challenge for the coming years, BP's chief executive Bernard Looney told the Financial Times in an interview published earlier this month. ""It's not going to make oil more in demand. It's gotten more likely [oil will] be less in demand,"" Looney told FT. BP's top executive joins other CEOs of major oil corporations who have recently expressed views that it's not guaranteed that global oil demand will return to its 'normal' pre-virus levels of around 100 million barrels per day (bpd).
 ""I don't think we know how this is going to play out. I certainly don't know,"" Looney said. ""Could it be peak oil? Possibly. Possibly. I would not write that off,"" BP's chief executive told FT. Last month, Shell's chief executive Ben van Beurden said on the earnings call that the current crisis is a ""crisis of uncertainty,"" and we don't know what's on the other side of it, as the supermajor slashed its dividend for the first time since World War II. According to IEA’s Birol, increased use of cars instead of public transport after the lockdowns and the depressed new passenger vehicle sales mean that oil demand for road transportation at least would recover faster than demand for other uses of oil."
Putin To Bail Out Russian Oil Industry.html,"Russia’s President Vladimir Putin has tasked the government with implementing a set of measures aimed at supporting the oil industry for the duration of the OPEC+ production cut agreement. According to a document published on the website of the Russian presidency, the measures include a prescription not to sanction companies that stray outside their production quotas and a temporary lifting of penalties for state oil companies for not sticking to their 2020/2021 investment programs.
 The document also lists “special rates” to be implemented by pipeline operator Transneft and Russian Railways for transporting crude oil and oil products for the duration of the OPEC+ deal. As part of the OPEC+ deal, Russia pledged to cut its production to 8.5 million bpd in May and June from a February 2020 baseline of some 11 million bpd, which translates into more than 2 million bpd, or by 19 percent, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak told Interfax in an interview last month. 
 However, many were sceptical the country would stick to its quota given its track record with the previous OPEC+ agreements. Yet this time the oil price crisis is serious enough to have spurred Russia’s oilfield operators into fast action, with Deputy Energy Minister Pavel Sorokin saying earlier this month that Moscow expects to achieve “the maximum reduction level as soon as practicable.”  According to Reuters calculations, Russia’s crude oil production—net of condensates—averaged 8.72 million bpd in the first twenty days of May. This is the largest production cut Russian producers have had to implement in decades, which is probably why the government is lending a hand to help them manage the situation. This situation will last until the end of June, after which the combined OPEC+ production cuts will be relaxed from 9.7 million bpd to 7.7 million bpd."
Oil May Never Fully Recover From This Crisis.html,"It’s a rule of thumb among epidemiologists that every epidemic is different and could be laden with surprises. It now seems the same applies to economic crises. During the last downturn, the one that started from the subprime mortgage crisis, the hardest-hit industries were, understandably, real estate and banking. Now, it’s oil and gas in the crosshairs, and nobody knows if the industry will ever be able to recover fully. Just like the coronavirus epidemic that started in China and within two months spread all over the world forcing people to stay at home, the March OPEC+ meeting that was supposed to lead to a deeper round of production cuts ended in a price war. It couldn’t have come at a worse time, but nobody could anticipate the lockdowns and shelter-in-place orders at the time. Since then, the odds have stacked up against oil and, to a lesser extent, against gas. Gas demand is more resilient than oil demand and likely to rebound faster. In oil, on the other hand, the uncertainty remains heightened, and that’s despite the recent price rally spurred on by a combination of favorable factors. European countries began to emerge from their lockdowns earlier this month. People began to move between places again. U.S. gasoline inventories booked an unexpected decline three weeks ago amid the lockdown that had decimated fuel demand. Then crude oil stockpiles began to decline as states started to ease their lockdowns. Following the Energy Information Administration’s Wednesday petroleum status report, West Texas Intermediate jumped closer to $40 a barrel, a price level not seen in months. Can it last? Nobody knows.

But as medical experts warn that the premature reopening of the U.S. economy could have even more disastrous consequences of an extended national lockdown. Besides the obvious harm, a second wave of infections, if realized, could once again weigh on oil demand. If such a second wave occurs, it would come at an even worse time for U.S. drillers. Some of them are probably planning to start ramping up production to generate some much-needed cash and avoid a permanent loss of production from shut-in wells. After all, they’ve done great so far: the combined production cuts in the U.S. and Canada are about 3.5-4.5 million bpd as of early May. But if they start ramping up and prices slump again because of a second wave of Covid-19, it’s easy to picture the chaos. Oil wells, after all, are not a light switch you can flip on and off.
 The issue of a second wave of infections certainly casts a shadow over the immediate—and the long term—future of oil, but there is also the issue of oil storage. Sure, prices have been improving on those early signs of improving demand, but they have been mainly improving because of the lower production reports and general optimism that things will eventually get better. Until they do, however, there are still hundreds of millions of crude oil barrels sitting in storage.  “I look at where we are today. The reason we are excited is we are past the worst point. If you think about the moment in the crisis where demand was at the lowest point and supplies were at the highest point, we’re past that,” Bank of America’s head of commodities, Francisco Blanch, told CNBC this week. “But we’re not out of the woods,” he added. Ten years ago, oil was one of the first industries to emerge from the crisis relatively unscathed, with demand strong and prices in the $80s. Now, it is likely to be among the last ones to recover from the double blow of demand destruction by the pandemic and the excess supply resulting from excessive production. And it may never recover fully."
Chinese Oil Imports To Rise In 2020 Despite Coronavirus.html,"Despite the low oil demand during the COVID-19 outbreak in China, the world’s top oil importer is set to increase its crude oil imports by 2 percent in 2020, thanks to the low oil prices, according to a research think-tank affiliated with state oil giant China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC).    China’s apparent crude oil consumption is expected to increase by between 1 percent and 2 percent year on year, CNPC Research says, as carried by Reuters. However, demand for refined oil products in China is forecast to record its first drop in two decades, as it is expected to fall by 5 percent this year compared to last year.   
 Natural gas demand is seen rising, but at the slowest pace in 20 years, as per CNPC, and this low growth could give the global liquefied natural gas (LNG) market another headache on top of the current oversupply and sluggish demand amid the pandemic. In crude oil, China’s demand has already rebounded to nearly pre-coronavirus levels, Bloomberg reported earlier this week, citing sources with inside knowledge of China’s energy sector. China was the first to go into lockdown after the COVID-19 virus emerged in Wuhan, but it was also the first country to exit lockdown. Demand for oil and fuels has been rising over the past month as people return to commuting to work, preferring their own vehicles to public transportation.
 Later this week, China could give more impetus to crude oil demand and imports, as China’s top policy-setting meetings are set to begin on Friday to chart the course for the Chinese economy hit by the coronavirus pandemic. The National People’s Congress (NPC), the most important policy-setting annual event in the Communist country, is expected to decide what stimulus to inject into the economy after it markedly slowed during the pandemic. Many of the potential decisions for supporting infrastructure and railroads and other commodity-intensive sectors could drive up China’s demand for crude oil, fuels, and other commodities, including steel and copper, according to Bloomberg News."
