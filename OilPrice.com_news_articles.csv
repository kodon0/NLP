Is A Shale Comeback On The Horizon.html,"It’s been a tough year for U.S. shale. Even before the novel coronavirus pandemic pummeled oil markets, the shale revolution had been pronounced dead, with investors shying away from the Permian Basin and shale wells drying up across West Texas.  A slowdown in the U.S. shale revolution was inevitable. “The nature of shale wells is that they decline in production much more rapidly than conventional wells, leading to inevitable slowdowns such as what we are currently witnessing in the once almighty Permian,” Oilprice reported in the Fall of last year.  “Shale wells lose as much as 70 percent of their production in the first year, meaning that explorers have to constantly pour money into more drilling just to maintain production. By contrast, once up and running, conventional wells lose as little as 5 percent each year, providing a much more solid production outlook,” Bloomberg reported in the same month.  And then COVID-19 arrived to kick U.S. shale while it was down, plunging the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude benchmark into previously unthinkable negative territory. On April 20, the WTI didn’t just slump, it plummeted below zero, closing out the day at -$37.63 a barrel. The severe downturn in oil markets hit the Permian Basin hard, and the U.S. shale industry has been subsequently swept by a massive wave of bankruptcies and fired and furloughed employees.  Throughout the downturn, however, there have been some optimistic voices. Just two days after the WTI went negative, Oilprice reported on one industry expert that said oil could even hit $100 in the near future once demand bounces back and the supply isn’t there to meet it. Other experts predicted that the pandemic-fuelled recession could leave the U.S. shale sector with only its best players still standing, and that the post-COVID Permian could therefore be better and more resilient than ever. 
  Related: Trading Giant Books Record Profit During Oil Crisis Now, there seems to be even more cautious optimism in the field. “No company has more skin in the U.S. domestic shale game than ConocoPhillips and its CEO, Ryan Lance. Which is why, in the midst of this current, COVID-19 induced downturn, it was encouraging to see Lance talk optimistically about the prospects of an industry comeback taking place in the coming months,” Forbes reported this week.  Forbes’ analysis is based on an interview that Lance had with IHS Markit Vice Chairman Dan Yergin, in which the CEO said that ConocoPhillips is considering beginning to reactivate shut-in wells in the Permian as their first steps to easing back into the market. “We’re thinking of slowly coming back into the market over the next few months and reducing the amount we’ve got curtailed because we’re seeing some strengthening in the price,” Lance was quoted. ConocoPhillips would be the biggest, but certainly not the first company to begin putting its Permian production back online. With this move they would “join other big Permian Basin producers like EOG Resources, Concho Energy and Parsley Energy” according to Forbes. 
 This does not mean, however, that shale will bounce back in the immediate future. A “v-shaped” recovery curve is highly unlikely. “Shale's not broke, shale’s not gone, shale will come back,” Lance was quoted. “But I do think it comes back slower because there is going to be pressure on companies to confine their capital program and maybe not grow as dramatically as before, because I don’t think the access to capital and investor community is going to be as robust as it was over the past decade.” This is not necessarily a bad thing. In fact, many experts say that economic recovery depends on whether the shale sector is able to practice restraint and take it slow.  “There’s a double risk on the horizon,” writes Julian Lee in an opinion piece for Bloomberg last month. “Just as lifting lockdowns too soon could bring a second spike in virus infections and deaths, loosening the hard-fought restraint in oil production too soon risks a second oil-price collapse.” And it’s not just U.S. recovery that’s at risk. If the U.S. shale industry doesn’t play its cards right, it could compromise the entire global oil market recovery. ",Positive
Country With Worlds Largest Oil Reserves Has Only One Rig Left.html,"The collapse in oil prices and the tightening U.S. sanctions against Venezuela have accelerated the decline of the oil industry in the country sitting on the largest crude oil reserves in the world.   As of May, Venezuela’s rig count plunged to just two, data from Baker Hughes shows, as production slipped by 16 percent to 645,700 barrels per day (bpd), Bloomberg reported on Thursday, citing documents containing production data it has seen. Of the two active rigs in Venezuela last month, one was working at an oilfield and another one was drilling for gas, according to Bloomberg. Those rigs are working in the Orinoco oil belt, where Venezuela’s state oil firm PDVSA operates oilfields in joint ventures with foreign firms, sources familiar with the matter told Bloomberg.   
 Venezuela’s oil industry was collapsing even before the oil price crash and the pandemic, due to the increasingly stricter sanctions in the U.S. maximum pressure campaign against Nicolas Maduro’s regime and its sources of revenues. Oil income is pretty much the only hard currency that Maduro gets, so the U.S. is looking to stifle as much of Venezuela’s oil trade as possible. In addition, PDVSA is severely cash-strapped and hasn’t invested in repair and maintenance of oil facilities and refineries in years. The price crash and the COVID-19 pandemic further exacerbated the crisis in Venezuela’s oil sector and PDVSA started shutting oilfields because of fewer international customers for Venezuelan oil, Bloomberg reports.
 In March, Venezuela had 25 operational oil and gas rigs, according to the Baker Hughes international rig count data. Venezuela has seen some reprieve recently in its fuel shortage problem, after Iranian tankers shipped gasoline and refining components to the Latin American country in an open defiance of the U.S. sanctions. Maduro’s regime tried to alleviate the fuel shortage in the country home to the world’s biggest oil reserves, but a new scheme of subsidized gasoline failed to put an end to the long lines in which Venezuelans queued to fill their cars with fuel.    ",Negative
Trading Giant Books Record Profit During Oil Crisis.html,"Commodity trading giant Trafigura reported a 27-percent increase in its net profit for the first half of its financial year, to March 31, citing strong physical trade in crude oil. Commenting on its results, the company said that “They show a strong performance by both trading divisions driven by significant volatility and dislocations in the global market, which make the physical trading and risk management activities of specialist companies such as Trafigura more relevant than ever.” Thanks to its strong position in an industry in turmoil, Trafigura noted its first-half net result was the best six-month result on record.
 The commodity major is also well position to benefit from the beginning improvement in oil demand. In late May, Reuters reported Trafigura had establishes a dominant trading position in North Sea oil, chartering 14 cargoes of local crude oil blends, benefiting from the fast and sharp change in prices driven by the OPEC+ cuts and still cheap freight rates. Besides oil trading, Trafigura also benefited from the new International Maritime Organisation’s emission rules that came into effect in January. “The Shipping and Chartering business also delivered a very strong performance having positioned itself strategically with an increased fleet and a sizeable equity position to benefit from the expected IMO 2020 market disruption, which did materialize,” Trafigura said.
 “Disruptions caused by OFAC sanctions that removed available VLCC tonnage and the deep contango market arising from COVID-19 oil demand drop supported freight rates and further enhanced the performance.” Yet not all may be rosy for the company. Last month The Guardian reported, without citing sources, that Trafigura was being investigated by the U.S. Commodities and Futures Trading Commission on allegations of corruption and market manipulation in crude oil trading. According to the unconfirmed report, the CFTC had issued subpoenas to a group of people with the order to hand over all information they have regarding the company’s activities for the last four years at least that may suggest “manipulation and corruption involving oil products and trading”.",Positive

Are Hedge Funds Done With Oil.html,"Things have been happening increasingly fast in the oil industry, especially with prices. With so much volatility around, price movements are quick and often surprising. Right now, the general optimism on oil markets is in decline, because of the latest price rally. It may sound counterintuitive, but it is, in fact, easy to explain. The prices of Brent and West Texas Intermediate have doubled since April. In the case of WTI, the rally was a lot higher than a doubling, too, if we take into account the swing below zero. As a result of this rally, there are already reports that U.S. shale oil producers are restarting shut-in production, and there are opinions from senior energy officials from OPEC+ members that the market is due for a deficit before the end of this year. Such opinions should have been bullish for oil, pushing prices even higher. Yet this hasn’t been the case. In fact, according to Reuters’ John Kemp, hedge funds have sharply reduced their oil contract buying. In his latest column on the topic, Kemp noted that funds had only bought 6 million barrels in the week to June 2. This was the lowest level of buying for the last nine weeks, Kemp noted. The expectation that U.S. shale drillers need just a little bit of push to start pumping more again must have been part of the changing sentiment. Another part was probably the disappointment that OPEC+ did not extend its deep production cuts for more than a month. OPEC may have discussed the option of a longer extension, but public reports did not mention it. Yet traders apparently expected a longer extension and remained unmoved by the actual extension, their sentiment reflecting on prices and barely moving them up. What’s more, there may be more bad news on the horizon. In a note earlier this week, Morgan Stanley said that the current oil price rally wouldn’t be a lasting one.
 The bank said this rally “appears mostly supply- rather than demand-driven, and it is questionable how strong refinery runs can increase against this backdrop.”  Related: Is Shell’s Dividend Cut Permanent? Indeed, we have yet to see how demand improves across the world, although the latest oil import and refinery run data from China is certainly encouraging. Oil shipments into the world’s largest importer hit an all-time high last month, at 11.34 million bpd, according to official customs data. Traffic figures from TomTom supported the impression of a strong recovery, suggesting that fuel demand was also on the rise. The question remains, however, how long will it take for this demand improvement to spread and will it be sustainable. Another question that is important in this context is when China will stop buying record amounts of crude. After all, refiners and traders spent the lockdown months stocking up on cheap—a lot cheaper than it is now—oil. The state also filled its oil reserves. In other words, China may have insulated itself from sharp oil price jumps for a while, at least. If prices rise too high, it will reduce buying, and this will pressure prices.
 But there is another perspective, too. A drilling industry executive told media last week that WTI could jump to as much as $70 in a few months because U.S. producers cut output too much too fast, which will cause a “mini-supply shock” on the local market. WTI has not traded at $70 or above since 2018. There are a lot of scenarios for oil, and when there are a lot of scenarios, traders get jumpier than usual, especially when every scenario has a relatively equal chance of playing out. With so many uncertainties still surrounding the coronavirus that prompted the lockdowns, which drained oil demand, and will uncertainties around the economic recovery of major oil consumers, price volatility will remain excessive. That’s about the only thing that is certain right now. Where prices will be tomorrow, on the other hand, is anyone’s guess.",Negative
The Real Reason China Is Importing So Much Oil.html,"China smashed its crude oil imports record in May as manufacturing activity picked up and lockdowns eased. Amid recovering demand for gasoline and diesel, China’s total demand is nearly back up to pre-coronavirus levels, which prompted refineries to ramp up crude processing rates.   On the face of it, China’s record crude oil imports last month are attributable to returning business activity and commuting, while road freight transportation gets a boost from deliveries of surging online sales. Yet, several other factors contributed to China’s record imports of crude oil in May.    The lowest oil price in years was the key driver of the boom in China’s crude imports in May—a month in which both its exports and imports suffered due to weak global demand amid lockdowns. China imported 47.97 million tons of crude oil in May, equal to a record-high 11.34 million bpd, preliminary data from the Chinese General Administration of Customs showed on Sunday.   According to data from IHS Markit, most of the record-high imports are indeed attributable to recovering oil demand in China, which was expected at 92 percent of ‘normal’ demand in May.  According to Wood Mackenzie, China’s oil demand is set to recover to 13 million bpd in the second quarter of 2020, up by 16.3 percent from Q1.  
  “China’s demand for gasoline and diesel are expected to increase YoY from Q3 2020 onwards,” the consultancy said at the end of May, adding that eased lockdowns and a preference for commuting in personal vehicles will push gasoline demand to a quick recovery. Gasoline demand will likely return to last year’s levels by June 2020.  Related: OPEC+ Agrees On Extending Record Output Cuts But the lowest oil prices in four years also triggered opportunistic buying from Chinese refiners. According to China’s preliminary customs data from Sunday, crude oil imports rose by 5.2 percent year-over-year between January and May – even though most of the time, China was under lockdown during this period. The value of the crude imports in U.S. dollars was down by 19.6 percent in the first five months of 2020, as per customs data, suggesting that low oil prices played an important part in China’s steady crude imports so far this year and the record-high imports in May. The 15-percent jump in imports in May compared to April “does not mean that Chinese consumption has fully recovered from Covid-19. Instead, this is most likely just opportunistic buying, given the low price environment the market has been in for the last few months,” ING strategists Warren Patterson and Wenyu Yao said on Monday. In recent weeks, China has been taking advantage of the cheapest crude oil in years to stock up as demand returns in the world’s largest oil importer. As of the middle of May, a huge fleet of 117 very large crude carriers (VLCCs) – each capable of shipping 2 million barrels of oil – was traveling to China for unloading at its ports between the middle of May and the middle of August, according to tanker-tracking data compiled by Bloomberg. China’s independent refiners--the so-called teapots—continued to actively procure oil in May, most likely because of the low prices, oil analytics firm OilX said last week, estimating that crude oil imports jumped by 13 percent from April to near record-highs of 11.11 million bpd in May. There has been a steady recovery in Chinese refinery crude processing rates in recent weeks to warrant higher imports. Still, at least some of the increased crude intake can be attributed to the Shanghai INE crude futures trading at a premium over other deliverable grades, OilX said.   Since April, Chinese hedge funds have been betting big on an oil price recovery on the Shanghai crude futures, which has led to major Chinese state oil firms, including PetroChina and Sinopec, delivering oil into the crude oil futures contract. 
  Related: OPEC+ Deal Fails To Give Prices Major Boost Yet another reason for China’s record oil imports could be the country anticipating further tensions in the U.S.-China trade relations, TS Lombard analyst Bo Zhuang told the Financial Times on Sunday. “China wants to fill up its oil tanks and soybean warehouses in case it couldn’t import these materials freely,” Zhuang told FT. China’s crude oil imports could slow down in the second half of the year, considering the rising oil prices and the uncertain global economic recovery, which could further stall demand for Chinese goods overseas. In addition, the upcoming refinery maintenance season and independents using up their import quotas could mean Beijing’s crude oil imports may not be as strong in the second half as in May, Michal Meidan, head of China research at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies, told Bloomberg.   ",Neutral
Is OPECs No2 Finally Complying With Output Cuts.html,"OPEC’s second-largest producer, Iraq, which also happens to be the least compliant member of OPEC+ since the group started managing supply to the market in 2017, may have finally started taking its obligations seriously. Iraq’s State Oil Marketing Organization (SOMO) has asked some of the Asian buyers of its Basrah crude grades if they could give up delivery of some already contracted cargoes for loading this month and next, sources familiar with the matter told Bloomberg News on Tuesday. The request for buyers to forgo some cargoes for those months suggests that this time, Iraq may be earnest in its attempt to play ball in the OPEC+ production cuts, after being the biggest cheater in all previous pacts.
 Iraq’s (as well as Nigeria’s) non-compliance with the record OPEC+ cuts in May nearly wrecked last week’s meeting of the pact, ahead of which the two leaders of the group, Saudi Arabia and Russia, had insisted that there would be an extension by one month to the current level of cuts only if laggards in compliance ensured over-compliance going forward to compensate for flouting their quotas so far. OPEC+ agreed on Saturday to extend the record production cuts of 9.7 million bpd by one month through the end of July, contingent on all countries in the pact complying 100 percent with their quotas and compensating for lack of compliance by overachieving in the cuts in July, August, and September. Before the meeting, Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister and then-acting Oil Minister, Ali Allawi, vowed that his country would further reduce production as it remains committed to the OPEC+ pact.
 At the video news conference following the OPEC+ meeting, Saudi Arabia’s Energy Minister, Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, emphatically said on Monday that “We have no room whatsoever for lack of conformity.” Today, Iraq’s new Oil Minister, Ihsan Abdul Jabbar Ismaael, confirmed in a phone call with his Saudi counterpart Iraq’s “full commitment” to the cuts, OPEC said in a press release on Tuesday. Iraq confirms “its commitment to the voluntary oil production adjustments of June and July 2020, as well as the voluntary adjustments for the period following the end of July, despite the economic and financial challenges,” Ismaael told the Saudi energy minister.

Libyas Largest Oil Field Shuts Down Just One Day After It Restarted.html,"Armed individuals entered Libya’s largest oil field, El Sharara, just a day after reports said the field had restarted production after months of idling amid the ongoing civil war. Another force majeure has been declared. Reuters quotes the National Oil Corporation as saying the “armed force” had told the workers on the field to stop working just hours after they had begun planned maintenance at the field. NOC itself told its employees not to obey that order. Details about the armed force were not disclosed. ""The armed group, which came from Sebha, stormed the Sharara oilfield and pulled their guns on civilian unarmed workers, coercing them to stop production at the field at dawn,"" the NOC said in a Tuesday statement.
 The first production phase at Sharara was supposed to begin at a capacity of 30,000 bpd, Libya’s state oil firm said in a statement, noting that production was expected to return to full capacity within 90 days due to the damages caused by the long shutdown. The field has a total production capacity of 300,000 bpd. Libya also restarted a second oilfield over the weekend, the 70,000-bpd El Feel which is linked to Sharara, a field engineer told Reuters on Sunday. Libya’s oil industry ground to halt after the Libyan National Army, a group affiliated with the eastern government of Libya, blockades the oil export terminals of the country. The blockade was part of the LNA’s offensive against Tripoli and the UN-supported government.
 Fighting has been ongoing since then, with oil production falling from over 1 million bpd to less than 100,000 bpd, with exports shrinking by 92 percent between January and May. The NOC also said last month the total losses incurred from the blockade and the production outages had reached $5 billion. “The first quarter of 2020 was a huge decrease in revenues for Libya, as a direct result of the illegal blockade of numerous oil and gas facilities. This is only part of the picture, as the corrosion in pipes caused by still oil and salt water is resulting in physical damage that will cost millions to fix when the crisis is over,” NOC’s chairman, Mustafa Sanalla said in late May.",Negative
Libya To Boot Production At Its Largest Oilfield.html,"Civil war-torn Libya has resumed oil production at its biggest oilfield, hoping to put an end to the bitter infighting that has crippled its oil output since the beginning of the year, but it is now giving OPEC and its allies another concern about rising supply just as OPEC+ extended its deep 9.7-million-bpd cuts by one month to the end of July. Libya’s oil industry has been in total disarray after a group of paramilitary formations affiliated with the Libyan National Army (LNA) of eastern Libyan strongman General Khalifa Haftar occupied Libya’s oil export terminals in January along with pipelines and fields. The blockade came amid continued fighting between the LNA, which is loyal to the eastern Libyan government, and the forces loyal to the Government of National Accord (GNA), which is recognized by the United Nations. As a result of the blockade, Libya’s oil production –which had stood at more than 1 million bpd at the start of January – collapsed to less than 100,000 bpd.
 Last week, the GNA said it had taken full control of Tripoli from Haftar’s LNA. Libya’s National Oil Corporation (NOC) said on Sunday that production at the 300,000-bpd Sharara oilfield had resumed after negotiating the opening of an oilfield valve that had been closed since January. The first production phase at Sharara will begin at a capacity of 30,000 bpd, Libya’s state oil firm said in a statement, noting that production is expected to return to full capacity within 90 days due to the damages caused by the long shutdown.
 Libya also restarted a second oilfield over the weekend, the 70,000-bpd El Feel which is linked to Sharara, a field engineer told Reuters on Sunday. The U.S. Embassy in Libya welcomed the re-opening of the Sharara oilfield, saying that “Now is the time for all responsible parties to reject attempts to militarize the energy sector & subjugate critical infrastructure to foreign interests.” While the resumption of much-needed oil production is crucial for Libya’s oil revenues and economy, the restart of Libyan oilfields could give OPEC+ another headache over the next few months, on top of the uncertainty about demand recovery. If Libya, which is exempt from the OPEC+ cuts, returns to pumping 1 million bpd in the coming months, “it would prove to be a bit of headache to OPEC+,” ING strategists Warren Patterson and Wenyu Yao said on Monday.",Neutral
Deep Output Cuts Could Cause Long Lasting Deficit In Oil Markets.html,"The forced oil production shutdowns and the extension of the generous OPEC+ voluntary cuts into July will not only balance the Covid-19-hit global crude and condensate demand, but are deep enough to create a monthly deficit starting from June 2020 and continuing uninterrupted until at least the end of next year, a Rystad Energy analysis shows. The oversupply, which sent WTI oil prices into the negative earlier this year, is a thing of the past as long as OPEC+ compliance stays strong and the oil demand recovery trajectory isn’t radically altered. The last surplus month appears to have been May, when crude and condensate production exceeded demand by about 6.1 million barrels per day (bpd). June is now already set for a global production deficit of about 1.5 million bpd. The imbalance is forecast to reach 4.6 million bpd in July, 4.2 million bpd in August and, after being reduced a little during the remainder of 2020, peak at 5.2 million bpd in January 2021. Although the shortfall will ease after that, Rystad Energy estimates that monthly deficits will remain throughout next year. “We believe OPEC+ is attempting to create a mini-bull-cycle by quickly tightening the prompt market, helping depressed prices and creating a supply environment that will facilitate a rapid relief of oil storages, as deficits will trigger large stock draws,“ says Rystad Energy’s Head of Oil Markets Bjørnar Tonhaugen.  Rystad Energy estimates that global crude and condensate production will stay below 80 million bpd for all the remaining months of 2020. Output will likely reach 71.4 million bpd in June and grow monthly to a high of 78.4 million bpd in December. Demand, on the other hand, is set to reach 72.9 million bpd already in June 2020 and exceed 80 million bpd from September onwards, reaching an annual monthly high of 82.3 million bpd in December. “However, if the oil price continues its steady ascension, this will spur reactivation of parts of the curtailed US oil production. Also, if frac crews end their holidays early, US volumes may be coming back more quickly than OPEC+ expects, bridging part of the deficit,“ adds Tonhaugen.",Positive
OPEC Agrees On Extending Record Output Cuts.html,"OPEC and its partners concluded their meeting on Saturday afternoon, announcing that it would extend its current production cut deal. Algeria’s Energy Minister Mohamed Arkab, OPEC’s current President summed up the group’s sentiment by saying that ""Despite the progress achieved to date, we cannot afford to rest on our laurels,''. The last couple of days, the cartel’s de-facto leader Saudi Arabia negotiated with other OPEC members and some non-OPEC countries including Russia, Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan to extend the current 9.7 million bpd output cuts for at least another month.
 Most countries partaking in the record production cuts were willing to continue the current deal, but poor compliance from countries like Iraq, Nigeria and Kazakhstan has caused discontent among other OPEC members, some of which have even made deeper cuts than agreed on in April. During the virtual meeting on Saturday, the cartel agreed that the countries that were unable to reach full conformity in May and June will have to compensate for this in July, August and September. Oil prices effectively doubled during the month of May as global demand started to recover and record output cuts and worldwide well shut-ins decreased the monster glut. 
 While the OPEC+ deal extension undoubtedly will have a bullish effect on markets, prices aren’t likely to rip much higher on Monday as the OPEC+ news has largely been priced in already.  For oil prices to make a full recovery, global demand will have to recover and crude inventories have to be drawn down, both of which will likely take up to two years. Pioneer’s Scott Sheffield said that the quick rebound of demand to around 94-95 mb/d following the “reopening” of so many economies will give way to stagnation, saying that demand won’t reach pre-pandemic levels until 2022 or even 2023. For now, the next bullish catalyst for oil could come from Saudi Aramco, which could set the trend for higher oil prices in June as it is expected to release its OSPs (official selling prices) on Monday. Aramco’s OSPs are often a leading indicator for Iraqi, Iranian and Kuwaiti crude prices, and last month, Brent futures rallied after Riyadh hiked its prices for crude to Asia.",Positive
Will US Shale Ever Return To Its Boom Days.html,"U.S. shale drillers are bringing back shut in production three months after the onset of the current downturn. But steep decline rates will increasingly take hold, dragging down overall U.S. output later this year.  With oil prices approaching $40 per barrel, many drillers are covering immediate operational costs. Rystad Energy estimates that “a bit more than 300,000 bpd” of shut in U.S. oil production has come back online.  A total of 1.15 million barrels per day (mb/d) was shut in in April and May, and that output will “return swiftly over July and August,” JBC Energy wrote in a note.  But that doesn’t mean U.S. oil production will rebound in a V-shaped fashion. “$40 is a blessing in disguise. Nobody’s going to add rigs, nobody’s going to add fleets at $40 oil,” Scott Sheffield of Pioneer Natural Resources told Bloomberg. “I’m trying to convince OPEC members that our industry has changed. It’s all about less growth, it’s all about returning cash back to the shareholders.” The return of shut in production is different from returning to drilling new wells. “I see no change at $40. We need to get up to $45 to $50 before you see people start adding rigs and add frack fleets,” Sheffield added. “Most companies have too much leverage,” and they are going to “use cash flow to repair balance sheets because the equity markets are closed. So, there’s not going to be a rush back to adding activity at all in my opinion,” he said. 
 Because shale wells decline precipitously, overall U.S. production will continue to decline, despite a temporary jolt from the return of shuttered wells. Sheffield puts shale decline rates at an average of between 35 and 40 percent per year without investment. A lot of drillers will try to keep output flat this year, or minimize decline. He estimates that U.S. oil production will be down below 11 mb/d by the end of 2021 because of declines.  Other analysts have similar outlooks. “[B]y September, the natural declines from shale wells will have accumulated to almost 2 million b/d, keeping US supply suppressed until mid-2021,” JBC said.   Related: Global Oil Demand To Fall To Levels Not Seen Since 2014 Goldman Sachs says the oil market’s outlook in 2021 is “broadly bullish,” due to “a more conservative outlook for Permian rampup.” After analysts with the investment bank met with six large Permian producers, the bank said that one of its key takeaways was that oil executives were serious about prioritizing cash flow and reducing leverage over the return to double-digit production growth. “Producers broadly characterized teens production growth as more an upside case than a base case,” Goldman analysts wrote in a note. The executives, Goldman says, are not expecting oil prices to rise into the $50s in 2021, instead predicting oil to remain in the $40s.  Oil remaining stuck in the $40s comports with the objectives of OPEC+, which hopes to keep a lid on a shale rebound. “The plan is to stick to prices of $40-$50 per barrel because as soon as they rise any further to say $70 per barrel it encourages too much oil production, including U.S. shale,” a Russian source familiar with OPEC+ talks told Reuters.
 The OPEC+ agreement and the short-term extension has rescued oil markets, and it may even lead to a supply/demand deficit in the second half of 2020. “As long as the demand recover stays intact, we believe the crude market will be in deficit also in August and onwards, despite cuts being tapered by 2 million bpd to the scheduled 7.7 million bpd level,” Rystad Energy’s Head of Oil Markets, Bjornar Tonhaugen, said in a statement. Rystad sees a stronger shale response from the deficit, with higher prices “spurring a quicker reactivation of curtailed US oil production, and eventually frac crews ending their holidays early.”  But the market will not go back to pre-pandemic conditions for years. In addition to the mountain of inventories that need to be worked off, U.S. shale has a wall of debt coming due. On top of that, while demand is on the upswing, it could flatten out well short of pre-pandemic levels.  Pioneer’s Scott Sheffield said that the quick rebound of demand to around 94-95 mb/d following the “reopening” of so many economies will give way to stagnation for a few years until a coronavirus vaccine can be widely distributed. He predicts that oil demand won’t rebound to pre-pandemic levels of around 100 mb/d until 2022 or 2023. ",Neutral
Will Canadian Oil See Any Federal Help.html,"Crushed by plunging oil prices and demand in the coronavirus pandemic, Canadian oil firms slashed budgets, dividends, and production to save their finances through one of the worst crises in the oil patch in recent memory. Canada’s oil industry welcomed in early May the federal government’s relief financing to help the sector stay afloat, saying it was still waiting for more details about the roll-out of the program.   A month later, Canadian oil companies are still struggling to understand what it takes to qualify for a federal government program. Meanwhile, industry representatives say they are unaware of any firm that can access financing under those programs. Meanwhile, the Canadian oil patch is struggling with a liquidity crunch amid low oil prices and demand, and some firms have already announced court-supervised restructuring processes or severely reduced borrowing bases by banks. The industry needs urgent financial relief, yet details about who is and who isn’t eligible for support are lacking. A program for large employers –including in the oil industry – comes with some strings attached, such as strict limits on dividends, share buybacks, and executive pay, and a requirement that companies publish annual climate-related disclosure reports. The financial support for the oil industry is not bailouts; it’s short-term loans to provide liquidity support to small- and mid-sized companies, plus the Large Employer Emergency Financing Facility (LEEFF) available to corporations, including in oil and gas.   Related: Iran To Reach Production Target At World’s Largest Gas Field This Year  “Liquidity is a major issue for companies: COVID-19 and the oil price crash have caused a rapid fall in revenues. While long-term recovery is expected, access to loans and other sources of funding is vital to allowing otherwise healthy companies to bridge through the current crisis,” the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP) says.   
 The thing is, no one has yet been able to access federal liquidity support and companies are still studying the programs available. “We have not seen one company access credit in any of those programs to my knowledge,” Jeff Tonken, chairman of the CAPP and President and CEO of Birchcliff Energy, told Reuters. Top executives at many Canadian oil firms are still waiting for specifics regarding the program for loans while their companies review the criteria for eligibility. Some managers believe that the federal government’s intentions are good, but the details are unclear, at best. Others feel deceived and question whether the federal government is sincerely intent on helping the oil industry. “It is a black box. I think the issue is nobody knows what you have to do to qualify for it or what the criteria are. And the concern is we needed that liquidity yesterday,” Athabasca Oil Corporation’s CEO Rob Broen told Calgary Herald columnist Chris Varcoe. Todd Brown, chief executive at Cequence Energy Ltd, tells Calgary Herald that the company was told it wouldn’t be eligible to access financial relief, even if the firm has just announced a strategic process to identify and pursue potential strategic options and alternatives through a court-supervised restructuring proceeding.  “I feel deceived. I feel like it was a fanfare by the federal government to try and provide window dressing to an industry that I am not sure it supports,” Brown told Calgary Herald’s Varcoe.

 Many Canadian oil firms are frustrated with the lack of clarity in the federal support programs, and no one in the industry has heard of anyone being able to access financing through them yet. The federal government has pledged to start rolling out the support this month, but for some firms in the Canadian oil patch, it could be too late. Delphi Energy, for example, said in April that it would explore strategic alternatives through a court-supervised restructuring proceeding. Bellatrix Exploration completed this week a court-approved sale of substantially all its oil and gas assets. Athabasca Oil Corporation still hopes to be able to access government support after announcing this week that its banking syndicate had renewed the reserve-based facility until November 30, but that the credit facility had been cut by 65 percent.   “The Company continues to pursue opportunities to access credit support offered by the Government of Canada during this uncertain economic environment created by the COVID-19 pandemic,” Athabasca Oil said. Meanwhile, the Canadian oil patch will continue to struggle at current oil prices, even after prices rallied in May after the crash in April, analysts say. The good news for Canada’s oil industry is that WTI Crude prices are back up to above $30 a barrel. “Although $30 is clearly better than the $16.70 that was the average in April, it’s still well below where it needs to be to keep Alberta’s oil patch from struggling,” ATB Economics said in a recent note.",Negative
Global Oil Demand To Fall To Levels Not Seen Since 2014.html,"Crude oil demand this year will fall to around 90.6 million bpd this year, OPEC’s secretary-general Mohammed Barkindo said ahead of the next OPEC+ meeting, as cited by Trend. This level of demand was last seen before 2014, when the oil market again swung into an oversupply and prices tanked as the Gulf producers fought U.S. shale.
 “World oil demand growth in 2020 is expected to drop by a staggering 9.07 mb/d, with the worst impact seen in this quarter. We expect demand for the year to be around 90.59 mb/d – back to levels last seen before the 2014-2016 market downturn,” the top official said. This is not good news because oil in storage remains high, according to the latest data from analytics firm OilX. Oil in floating storage has begun to be drained, OilX said, but oil in onshore storage was still rising in May. To date, total oil in onshore storage is above 4.5 billion barrels. Of this, some 1 billion barrels flowed into storage in the past couple of months and will take a lot longer to clear up.
 The drawdown in oil stocks may accelerate as economies recover from the Covid-19 crisis, but since OPEC+ will tomorrow be discussing a one-month extension of its deepest production cuts, the sentiment in the cartel seems to be still largely bearish. However, Russia may be more optimistic: Energy Minister Alexander Novak said earlier this week that he expected the oil market to swing into a shortage in July. Whatever happens, the effect of the crisis has already been devastating for the industry. Barkindo noted that investment in oil and gas could fall by as much as 23 percent this year from last, to about 50 percent of the record-high $741 billion invested in 2014. There will be bankruptcies and layoffs in what the official called a repeat of the 2014-2016 scenario.",Negative
Did Iraq Just Doom The OPEC Deal.html,"OPEC is in negotiations with its members to find the best way forward, but talks appear to have stalled over one laggard, Iraq, which has failed to live up to its agreement under the cartel’s production cut deal. Does this give OPEC cover for meeting delays and overall noncompliance, or is it a sincere effort to get it onboard? Whether Iraq can be brought in line and fully comply with its share of the OPEC deal is certainly doubtful. Yet interestingly enough, OPEC and Russia have staked the extension of the dealy past June, when the current level of cuts expire and cuts begin to ease, entirely on whether all laggard members bring production down to agreed-upon levels.  Either OPEC and Russia are certain they can get Iraq to bring its production down to its quota, or they are content to have the cartel’s production above normal.  Russia and Saudi Arabia both agreed that the current level of production cuts should be extended at least one more month. The caveat? That all other countries implement their established quotas in full.  That’s a pretty big ask, and if history repeats itself, it’s impossible. What this means for oil prices is that there would be no extension, inventories won’t draw down as quickly, and oil prices will remain depressed along with demand for crude--which although it is picking back up thanks to lockdowns being lifted, is still about 20 million barrel per day under what it was before the pandemic.  Iraq isn’t the only laggard, to be fair. Nigeria, Angola, and Kazakhstan are also not keeping up their end of the bargain. The cartel went to work trying to get the three, and Iraq, to recommit to the cuts, and with the exception of Iraq, all three gave the requisite assurances.   Related: Are Investors Ignoring The Largest Financial Risk Ever? Of course, that doesn’t mean they will necessarily do so, but it’s at least a start. 
 Iraq, however, has not committed to bringing its production down to the quota in June.  OPEC’s compliance for May is thought to be about 89%. This isn’t terrible considering the volume of how much is being cut. Still, compliant Saudi Arabia is declaring its unwillingness to continue its share of the cuts for another month unless the laggards get their act together. Laggards that include Iraq, whose compliance reached only about 42% in May. OPEC won’t even have the meeting this week unless Iraq agrees to improve its compliance.  Is it all just a ploy to manage market expectations in the run up to the meeting to ensure that whatever agreement is hatched is looked upon favorably, therefore maximizing the price impact? Is it a strategy to get out of extending the deal, perhaps as discussed with U.S. President Donald Trump? Is it designed to put maximum pressure on Iraq to comply?  Chances are, we’ll never know. But one thing is for certain: Iraq will not comply with the deal--period.  In fact, it said as much. Iraq said it would fully implement cuts by the end of July-in their promise-to-fulfill-later kind of way that they have done in the past.  Iraq the Laggard
 For the most part, when it comes to chronic noncompliance, we are talking about the usual suspects of Iraq and Nigeria. But Iraq is so much bigger.  Both countries have unique challenges when it comes to sticking to any production cut deal that OPEC or OPEC+ could ever hatch. For Iraq, it is their reliance on international oil companies, most of which operate in the semi-autonomous Kurdistan region. So on one hand, Iraq doesn’t want to bite the hand that feeds it--big foreign oil companies--and on the other, Iraq has a tough time trying to regulate what goes on in the Kurdistan region. This is not even to mention the rocky political climate in Iraq.  Related: Can Yemen’s Oil Industry Make A Comeback? For Nigeria, it’s the fact that it has a strong reliance on its oil revenues. Most OPEC nations rely on oil revenue for a substantial part of the revenue. But for Nigeria, shutting down oil production and forgoing the revenue associated with that oil production is tough.  Yet Nigeria has agreed, although its May compliance was still not up to snuff. OPEC’s Other Problem Is OPEC really worried about the extra barrels Iraq is pumping? After all, Saudi Arabia has overachieved its own quota for well over a year while the laggards basked in their overproduction. Most signs point to legitimate worry. Saudi Arabia has declined to publish its July OSP for July until after the meeting. The Kingdom is also raising its customs duties on hundreds of products to generate more non-oil revenue. In a similar vein, it’s tripling its VAT and suspending its cost of living allowances. These are worrisome signs. What’s most concerning in the market, however, is the notion that the OPEC deal could fall apart entirely.  The previous deal catastrophe is all too fresh in our minds after Russia and Saudi Arabia--the two heavyweights in the deal--failed to reach an agreement over the cuts. The deal failure triggered a price war between the two, plunging the world into a glut of oil and sending prices spiraling as demand fell in the wake of the pandemic. ",Negative
Chinas Crude Oil Imports Rebound To Near Record High.html,"China’s crude oil imports jumped by 13 percent from April to near record-highs of 11.11 million bpd in May, due to favorable spreads of the Shanghai-traded yuan-denominated oil futures and a ramp-up in refinery throughput, oil analytics firm OilX said in a report this week. There has been a steady recovery in Chinese refinery crude processing rates in recent weeks to warrant higher imports, but at least some of the increased crude intake can be attributed to the Shanghai INE crude futures trading at a premium over other deliverable grades, OilX said.   Since April, Chinese hedge funds have been betting big on an oil price recovery on the Shanghai crude futures, which has led to major Chinese state oil firms, including PetroChina and Sinopec, delivering oil into the crude oil futures contract.  
 Apart from the Shanghai crude futures and recovering crude processing rates, another factor in China’s near-record imports of crude was the fact that the independent refiners – the so-called teapots—continued to actively procure oil, most likely because of the low prices, OilX’s analysts Juan Carlos Rodriguez and Valantis Markogiannakis noted. China’s crude oil imports in May were up by 1.28 million bpd compared to April and up by 1.27 million bpd compared to May last year, OilX said. China’s imports from Saudi Arabia jumped by 800,000 bpd, following declines in the two previous months, while imports from Iraq surged by more than 400,000 bpd as the Basrah crude grade is one of the seven grades allowed under the Shanghai crude futures contract, OilX data showed.
 China’s imports are rebounding and its oil demand is also steadily recovering, according to analysts. In recent weeks, China has led the global oil demand recovery, while tentative signs of improvement emerge in other major economies, including the United States and India, as lockdowns are eased. In China, oil demand was at 90 percent of the pre-COVID-19 levels in April, and was expected at 92 percent of ‘normal’ demand in May, according to data from IHS Markit. ",Positive
Canadian Crude Exports Drop 55 Following Oil Price Crash.html,"The oil price and demand crash in April resulted in Canada’s energy exports plunging by the most on record, with crude oil exports plummeting by 55.1 percent, Statistics Canada said on Thursday, reporting the lowest levels in total merchandise trade in a decade.    As the coronavirus pandemic and the lockdowns to contain it crushed demand for oil in Canada’s key export market, the United States, exports of energy products plunged by US$2.66 billion (C$3.6 billion), the largest decrease on record, which was mostly due to the plunge in crude oil exports.  “Reduced demand for energy products in April due to confinement measures resulted in a drastic decrease in crude oil export prices, as well as lower export volumes,” Canada’s statistics office said today.  
 The price of Western Canadian Select (WCS), the benchmark price of oil from Canada’s oil sands delivered at Hardisty, Alberta, typically tracks the trend in prices of WTI Crude, which plunged in April and hit a negative $-37 a barrel on April 20, a day before the May contract expired. “Despite the recent increase in market prices, crude oil export prices are likely to remain low in May, as crude oil price fluctuations are generally observed in export data with a certain delay,” Statistics Canada said today. Canada’s crude oil imports also slumped in April, by 61 percent, due to weak demand and the partial or complete closure of a number of Canadian refineries that import crude oil.  
 Energy trade was the second-largest contributor to Canada’s worst trade data in a decade, while the biggest decrease in imports and exports was registered in the automotive sector because of factory shutdowns, according to Statistics Canada data. Over the past two months, low crude oil prices have forced many Canadian companies to cut dividends and curtail heavy oil production in view of the unsustainably low prices for their oil.  ",Negative
China Leads The Global Oil Demand Recovery.html,"Global oil demand has improved over the past few weeks, led by China’s demand which has rebounded to 90 percent of its pre-coronavirus levels, while tentative signs of improvement emerge in other major economies, including the United States and India, as lockdowns are eased. In China, oil demand was at 90 percent of the pre-COVID-19 levels in April, and was expected at 92 percent of ‘normal’ demand in May, according to data from IHS Markit. “The brisk resumption of Chinese oil demand, 90 percent of pre-COVID levels by the end of April and moving higher, is a welcome signpost for the global economy. When you consider that oil demand in China—the first country impacted by the virus—had fallen by more than 40% in February—the degree to which it is snapping back offers reason for some optimism about economic and demand recovery trends in other markets such as Europe and North America,” said Jim Burkhard, vice president and head of oil markets, IHS Markit.
 According to Wood Mackenzie, China’s oil demand is set to recover to 13 million barrels per day (bpd) in the second quarter of 2020, up by 16.3 percent from Q1.    “China’s demand for gasoline and diesel are expected to increase YoY from Q3 2020 onwards,” the consultancy said at the end of May, adding that eased lockdowns and preference for commuting in personal vehicles will push gasoline demand to a quick recovery and it is likely to return to last year’s levels by June 2020. India’s fuel demand, which had crashed by 60 percent during the early days of its two-month lockdown, is set to reach pre-coronavirus levels in June, Indian Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan said last week.
 In the United States, average national gasoline prices rose last week, and part of the increase can be attributed to higher gasoline demand, which saw a 7-percent week-over-week increase, AAA said earlier this week.   “Americans are slowly but steadily returning to driving, causing gas prices to increase across the country,” AAA spokesperson Jeanette Casselano said.",Positive
Bahrain To Speed Up Development Of Huge 80 Billion Barrel Oil Reserves.html,"Given the massive negative hit taken by Saudi Arabia’s economy as a result of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s oil price war, aimed at destroying the U.S. shale oil industry yet again (given how well it worked last time, of course), Saudi’s ability to help its tiny neighbour, Bahrain, has been dramatically reduced. The irony here is that Bahrain’s economy had not recovered from the deleterious effects of the first oil price war launched by the Saudis against the U.S. in 2014 before it was hit again by the second. Even before the full reckoning of the costs of MbS’s latest folly is made on Bahrain’s economy, its gross domestic product contracted by 1.4 per cent in the fourth quarter of last year, and it now has a fiscal breakeven Brent oil price of at least US$91.80 per barrel (pb), according to IMF figures. One potential positive outcome for Bahrain, however, is that it may gain more independence from Saudi Arabia as a result of it having to push ahead unilaterally in developing its newly-found oil and gas reserves. To the casual observer it might appear that Bahrain has in the past been indolent in pushing ahead with developing its oil and gas sector but this is in large part a consequence of the delicate political balance between it and Saudi Arabia. At the most basic level, whilst the clear majority of Bahrainis are Shia Muslims, the ruling Khalifa royal family (and many of the senior figures elsewhere in the country) is Sunni, as is Saudi Arabia. This religious-political discrepancy has been a source of friction over the years, reaching a peak in the Arab Spring’s Bahrain uprising of 2011. At that point, in order to ensure its continuation, Bahrain’s ruling House of Khalifa called in military support from Saudi Arabia to help quell the protests. So close is the relationship with Saudi Arabia that Bahrain was one of the very few countries that voiced support for Saudi Arabia after MbS ordered the torture, murder, and dismemberment of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, according to the CIA, among others. Economically as well, Saudi Arabia may have been responsible for various degrees of financial destruction on Bahrain with its two previous oil price wars but it has also provided some compensation for it in the past. In 2018, for example, just two years after the end of the first oil price war, Saudi Arabia was pivotal in organising a US$10 billion rescue package for Bahrain, funded by Saudi and the U.S.’s other allies in the region – Kuwait and the UAE. This formed an integral part of Bahrain’s new fiscal programme that aimed to eliminate its budget deficit by 2022. Although the US$10 billion was not sufficient to cover all of Bahrain’s funding at that point, it was useful in allowing Bahrain to continue to tap the international markets if required, signalling backstop support from the three countries.

  Similarly, Bahrain’s hydrocarbons industry has in large part been inextricably linked to that of Saudi’s for some considerable time. Bahrain’s two core revenue streams from oil are its onshore Awali site (domestically operated) and the offshore Abu Safah site, which is operated jointly with Saudi and the revenues from which are split between the two countries. Currently, Bahrain generates output of less than 200,000 barrels per day (bpd), of which around 150,000 bpd comes from the shared Abu Safah field. Moreover, its total current documented onshore oil reserves of 125 million barrels – according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) - in the Awali oil field will last less than seven years at the current rate of production. However, given Saudi Arabia’s own strained finances and Bahrain’s worsening debt profile, Oil Minister Mohammed bin Khalifa Al-Khalifa announced last week that Bahrain is going to roll-out a virtual (in the first instance) road-show to tempt international oil and finance companies into the development of the massive new find announced in 2018 but relatively undeveloped since then. The 2,000 square kilometre tight oil and deep gas resources in the Khalij Al Bahrain basin, off Bahrain’s west coast, remains by far the biggest oil and gas find in the Kingdom since 1932, estimated to contain at least 80 billion barrels of tight oil and up to 20 trillion cubic feet of gas. Given the EIA estimate that the average recovery factor for tight oil deposits ranges from three per cent to six per cent of the initial oil in place, and using the lower the figure, Bahrain’s new oil find could yield up to 2.4 billion barrels of recoverable oil reserves. This equates to around 20 times more than the Kingdom’s current onshore proved reserves and would allow it to double its current total crude oil production for the next three decades.
 From a virtually standing start right now to the onset of significant flows from the reservoir the process is estimated to take around five years at minimum but as interim exploratory drilling results emerge over that period (the U.S.’s Halliburton is involved in this respect), Bahrain is banking on being able to tap into the international debt markets for short-term capital. “At the same time, it might look to follow the Oman model and sell-off some of its state assets, at least in part, beginning with stakes in pipelines or plants, and then looking at more upstream assets as the oil price continues to recover,” a legal source in Abu Dhabi told OilPrice.com last week. “The government may well look to sell a share in its LNG [liquefied natural gas] facility that was completed earlier this year,” he underlined. Developed under a public-private partnership, the Bahrain LNG import terminal is located offshore approximately four kilometres east of the onshore receiving facility at the Khalifa Bin Salman Port, with an initial capacity of 800 million standard cubic feet per day.",Neutral
Oil Falls Back On Large Fuel Build.html,"A day after the American Petroleum Institute surprised market yet again with a crude oil inventory draw, pushing prices up, the Energy Information Administration also reported an inventory decline, at 2.1 million barrels for the week to May 29. At 532.3 million barrels, the authority said, crude oil inventories were 12 percent above the five-year average for this time of the year. Analysts had expected an inventory build of 3.3 million barrels, after last week the EIA reported a substantial inventory increase, at 7.9 million barrels, for the third week of May. Last week, gasoline inventories rose, however, by 2.8 million barrels, following a modest draw of 700,000 barrels a week earlier. Gasoline production over the last week of May averaged 7.8 million bpd, up from the previous week, when the average was 7.2 million bpd.
 In distillate fuels, the EIA reported an inventory build of 9.9 million barrels for the week to May 29. This was up from an inventory increase of 5.5 million barrels for the previous week. Distillate fuel production averaged 4.7 million bpd last week, compared with 4.8 million bpd a week earlier. Refinery runs averaged 13.3 million bpd in the last week of May, compared with 13 million bpd a week earlier, signaling the continued improvement in fuel demand as the United States emerges from lockdowns. Prices this week have been on the climb, even before the API reported its estimate of a crude oil inventory draw. At the time of writing, Brent crude was trading at $$39.36, after touching $40 for the first time in months yesterday, and West Texas Intermediate was changing hands at $36.87 a barrel.
 There is growing optimism that the OPEC+ club will later this week agree to continue cutting production at the current rate of 9.7 million bpd even beyond the end-June deadline for the deep cuts. There is also optimism, although more guarded, about the global economy in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. Both have contributed to a more bullish view on oil prices.",Positive
